1,"Great chicken and rib combs which include a drink. Can't beat that!. Ribs are seasoned and cooked to perfection. Even though, the restaurant provides you with a secret sauce, you don't need any sauce. The secret sauce is sweet and tangy. \n\nThey have many interesting side dishes. The spinach and feta salad is perfectly blended. They have a wide variety of healthy menu choices including wraps. The cucumber salad is divine! You can find it in the free salad bar. It's sweet, salty, and sour taste plays tricks with your tongue. \n\nLooking to cater an event? They will do it for you!"
0,"This place is a joke.  The food tastes like it came out of cans and boxes, absolutely no flavor at all, overpriced, and the person who took our order was rude and generally unpleasant.  If you want good Italian food go to Gaetano's.  It's just a few miles north on Eastern.  It is much better the atmosphere is much more pleasant, and the people are friendly and knowledgeable.  Or if you are willing to go a little further there is also Maggiano's Little Italy, at the fashion show Mall.  Go anywhere, but but this place, it is a waste of time and money."
1,"Good food with a fun atmosphere.  I like everything that I get here, sometimes they get a little crowded and the service can be slightly on the slow side, but overall it's worth at least one visit."
0,"What a painful process it was purchasing our car here. If it was a brand new vehicle, we would've DEFINITELY headed to another dealership...but my husband fell in love with a used car here, so we stayed despite our better judgement. \n\nOur salesman Mark was very nice, but the way he had to keep going back and forth with his badboy sales manager Chris to negotiate and kept playing the \""I'm stuck in the middle\"" song over and over, it quickly became annoying. After 2+ hours of getting nowhere, my husband gave up and left. They called him back numerous times with the \""it won't last at this price\"" and \""after today the price goes up $500\"" shpeel. All of a sudden it was \""urgent\"" that he decide. He told them he needed to think it over after they just pissed him off. So we go back a few days later after he cools down and guess what...the car is still there!! He signs the purchase agreement and gives a $500 deposit check (which we're told would be destroyed when they receive our bank funds and we pick up the car), no problem. A few days later I check our banking transactions online and find they have cashed the deposit check. Say what? That wasn't the plan. Ok...I'm assuming they'll just issue us a check for the $500 overpayment when we pick up the car. NOPE. They tell us it is their \""policy\"" to wait until the certified bank funds clear. Makes no sense, but I'm so frustrated at this point, we drive home the car that we just overpaid for...which by the way was not cleaned out (soda in the cup holder, floor carpet on driver's side dirty) AND was only filled with 1/4 tank of gas. I'm not exactly sure what their miscellaneous dealership \""fees\"" cover, but a full tank of gas is not an unreasonable expectation. \n\nFast forward 3 weeks later and after a phone call with their finance manager Josh, who could provide no reasonable excuse for the delay, we finally received a check for overpayment on the car. Never again will we do business here. Ever. Not when there are a thousand other dealerships around town."
1,"Headed here yesterday in search of a food mill.  Although they didn't have one, they were super helpful in suggesting places that might.  The place is orderly, clean and the staff was very friendly."
1,"Not sure what Taina was referring to below, her photo of her nails looks completely normal. Despite that review I went here a few hours after, had my nails done by the same gentleman and love them! They were great, had nice conversation and my nails look exactly as I had hoped. I will be back, and they even guaranteed their work for two weeks. Taina should try speaking up during a service if it is not to her liking. Geez."
1,"Ohhhhhh Chevy's how I love you. Their chicken fajita salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Crispy greens, grilled chicken, pepita seeds, avocado, salsa...yes please. Chevy's also likes to do a fruit of the month where they will make lemonades and margarita's using this fresh fruit puree. I had a cantalope lemonade, and let me say, one of the most refreshing delicious drinks EVER! I've also had their watermelon lemonade and mango lemonade, also great. Their chips and salsa are always great as well. The only so-so occasionally is the service."
1,This is the best Chinese place in Las Vegas! If you ever get a chance please check this place out. I've been going here for a couple of years and the owners wife still remembers me and my family. Lunch special is $6 huge portions and you also get soup. The hot and sour soup is the way to go. Also order a side of chicken wings. I've brought many of my friends here and they've enjoyed it just as much as I have. I don't really write reviews but for Mr. Beijing it's a must. Echo (the owners wife) she is great!  Always enjoy having lunch or dinner here! It may be small but the food will blow your taste buds.
0,"food sucks, service sucks...but the waiters sing and thats a barrel of laughs. theres also a gay guy who works there, and he must be the only gay in that village...vegas is way homophobic."
0,"The view is nice.  Food was terrible.  When we called they made a point to tell us there was a dress code, so we dressed for the occasion.  The bar above us had locals in concert t-shirts and flip flops hanging over the railing above us.  $200 for dinner and the food was really bad.  Not worth the price or the effort getting dressed up."
0,"I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful."
1,Amazing service! And the food is bomb!!! Love it! The fried ice cream is to die for!!!
0,Waited an hour as a new patient even when told to come 30 minutes early... About three women were taken back before me. Every station or room I went I waited even longer. And not only that but the nurses were condescending and also a little strange. By the time I saw Dr. Gatlin it had been two hours since I arrived. As a new patient is this how you want me to remember your office?
0,"So my family and I tried to get some yogurt here but there was a notice on the door that the owner hasn't paid the rent and the landlord kicked them out as of 1/11/13. Oh well, there's Yogurt+ down the street at least."
0,"I went here a few different times. Fine dining? NOT! How would you like to be sitting down in a place where all they do is smoke while you eat? The waitress takes a half an hour just to come and greet you upon arrival (self-seating), not to add she doesn't even have a smile for you when she finally gets to your table. First time there I had some food and didn't feel good the next day, second time there I just drank juice/coffee cuz I was scared to eat there again. Third time I sat outside and had a glass of wine and waited an hour and a half to get my dang bill, then decided I better go in and ask for the check myself."
1,"The Tri Centre is located in the middle of the busy and bustling South Clerk street and is heaven for all the sporting enthusiasts. The shop sells everything you could ever need to either compete in a triathlon, or just to go for a jog or a bike ride. The staff in The Tri Centre are incredibly knowledgeable about all the stock they sell and are happy to advise customers on which goods, such as bikes or wetsuits would be best suited to what they are keen to do. \n\nOne of my friends is a keen triathlete and is always in this shop buying new running or swimming gear. The good thing about The Tri Centre is that you don't have to be a sporting obsessive to go into the shop as it is great if you just want a good pair of running shoes or a decent bike. The quality of the goods is excellent which is reflected in the price - about \u00a380 - \u00a3110 for trainers. They also sell lots of accessories such as hats, gloves, sunglasses, bike wheels and energy food."
0,"I'm happy that we only stayed here for one night (only because we were partying at Hakkasan) because our stay at MGM was disappointing... and we only stayed there for less than 12 hours before checking out and checking in early to our next hotel.\n\nThe check-in process was time consuming.  Even though we got in at 11:30 PM, there was still a long line that went past the ropes and it took us about 45 minutes to go through the line.  We had a pleasant check-in experience with the front desk concierge, who kindly upgraded us to a bigger room for no extra charge.\n\nThe hotel itself tries to do aroma marketing, but it's way too strong.  The smell reminds me of a mix of Chanel No. 5 and vanilla.  Our room was located at the North Tower, and there were no actual signs on the boards that lead us to the tower.  We had to ask two associates before receiving the correct directions.\n\nOur room was a little small for Vegas standards and the bathrooms were even smaller (with only one sink for 2 queen beds!).  The mirror was the best thing about the bathroom because it had great lighting. (A plus for the ladies!)  Another plus about our hotel room was that the scent of the aroma marketing wasn't used there.  On the other hand, there was a variety of different dining options located throughout the hotel that were available."
0,"4/11/13\n\n2.50 stars...\n\nVisited for the first time today to have my hybrid car's oil changed.  As usual, car dealerships tend to be costlier than independent auto shops, but my last few visits to the dealership has left me very suspicious of how much I'm being charged and what services are actually being performed.  I decided to check Yelp for options and stumbled upon a review by a Yelper I met once, a long time ago during a vegetarian meetup (I think), and he suggested I look up a valley car care radio and TV personality Mark Salem's website.  On it, I found a few shops that can service both our Toyota hybrid models.  After a few emails with a couple of Scottsdale shops' managers, I decided to try Whitey's.  The other shop gave me a quote for a complete maintenance service ($$$) that was almost as much as what I'd pay at the dealership, whereas Whitey's general manager Scott Almhjell gave me the option of just getting an oil change, which includes an inspection that would then tell me if the car needed more work.  (Our hybrid models' oil only needs to be changed every 10K miles, instead of the standard car model's usual 5K req.)  I'm now wondering if I should've just gone with the other shop to get the full service, as I don't want to skimp now, and pay heavily later.\n\nI suppose I would've left a lot happier had the shop washed my car.  I wasn't EXPECTING that Whitey's would do so, but excellent customer service usually gets the customer to return.  I know that the dealership would've done so, but I also understand that the dealership has a Danny's Car Wash next door to it.  I very much appreciated that my contact at the shop, named Sean, had someone available (Alex) to drop me off at the restaurant of my choice, less than a mile away, so that I could have breakfast while the car was being worked on, and that I was able to enjoy a nice, long stroll around Civic Plaza before calling the shop so that I may get a ride back.  There certainly was ample time to wash the car, and this would certainly have created the warm buzz of positivity about taking my business here and would've guaranteed my return for another service, possibly one that would cost a couple of Benjamin Franklins and change, instead of the $35 plus tax that I was charged for today's oil change.\n\nI'm omitting an observation I made when I returned to my car after I'd paid for the service, because I don't want to seem too critical, and I was truly hoping I'd find myself able to trust this auto shop for both of our hybrids' care.  Probably not going to be a repeat customer."
0,"I heard and read about this place here from yelp and others I know. So finally I went to give it a shot only to realize ehhhh it was not really worth the long wait (45 minutes for party of 4)  and the drive for me. I ordered the egg Benedict one of my only favorite breakfast items. I just did not care for it!! Something about it and the textures of the whole thing did not go together. I ordered it standard with no tweaking or changing and to me it just did not do it, the other dish I had tried was the coned beef with potatoes and eggs that was alright. Probably better in my opinion than the egg Benedict if you had to choose.   Over all I do not think I would do it again."
0,"I walked into Black Bean, and then promptly had to walk back out and re-examine the artist formerly known as Ginza. I was taken aback by the prodigious amount of Chinese writing that I saw, before realizing that they are both a Cuban and Chinese restaurant.\n\nExcited at the prospect of a marvelous Cuban Sammie and Authentic Chinese, I ordered the latter and some of the former.\n\nThe food arrived quickly....almost too quickly. My girlfriend and I opted to split and sample. She once made me fall in love with a Cuban Sandwich that she had made, so I expected a near orgasmic experience from an authentic Cuban. \n\nAlas, my gastro-consumation was an awkward affair. The sandwich was very bland. The bread was not toasted, and every ingredient seemed to be indistinguishable from the next. One of the hallmarks of a good Cuban is toasted bread, a distinct layer of crunchy pickle, and delicious slathering of mustard. This had none of that. \n\nThe authentic Chinese menu seemed to have many devoted patrons, though I found ours once again to be bland. Perhaps I did not order this one correctly among the myriad of choices."
0,Was dead bored and fell asleep.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
0,"I was supremely excited about a revolving sushi restaurant. I was severely disappointed. The sushi was mostly rice, which is just bad form. The flavors were almost nonexistent. The quality of the fish was obviously poor, it was tough and chewy. The dessert was a joke! There was a cheap variety of desserts I wouldn't touch with a ten foot poll. The server was very friendly, but took a long break right in the middle of our visit, so when we went to pay, it was very confusing and we ended up staying an extra ten minutes due to confusion amongst the servers and the misplacing of our check. It was ridiculous. It was a fun time, because my inexperienced boyfriend got to try out a bunch of different kinds of rolls, but I would not ever choose to go back willingly."
0,closed for ever
0,"We had horrible service! I couldn't believe how rude our waitor was when my friend asked a question about the butter, garlic sauce. The reply we got was \""it's butter & garlic\"" wow, they pay you to say that??!! When I ask for suggestions & ask what a sauce tastes like & what the base is I want a server that's going to be happy to tell me about the menu & the food. The chicken parm was ok but not very flavorful & I didn't  like the garlic cheese bread. Overall didn't like it & will not come back. Olive Garden & Bucca de Beppo are much better & have way friendlier servers!"
1,"Hubby and I finally made it here last night. The area is definitely a little shady and the restaurant itself is surely nothing special to look at. We walked in and nobody was there. No biggie; I was trusting fellow Yelpers that it was good. The lady that waited on us was super duper nice. The chips weren't the freshest, but the salsa was awesome. It had a nice heat, which we love. We each ordered a crab tostada, and you could definitely tell it wasn't the fake stuff. It tasted good, until about halfway in I started getting too much lime flavor (which I don't care for) so I let hubby have the rest. He gobbled em up and loved every bit. Next came our molcajete. We obviously had to order them due to the rave reviews. I loved the presentation. Hubby got the mixed seafood one, which was shrimp, octopus, and snail. I opted for just shrimp. The tortillas it comes with are fresh and warm and delicious. The soup is spicy and flavorful and pretty damn good. I did, however, get a few shrimp that tasted a little funny. I don't think they were rotten seeing as I'm not sick, but just tasted a little off. The tomato broth did kinda make me \""gaggy\"" toward the end but overall it was tasty. We had a restaurant.com certificate, and the total bill + tax came to $50 or so, but we only ended up paying $27. Hooray for discounts! :)"
0,Very average Spanish food. In fact I found the paella to be extremely oily.  Way overpriced for what you get for your dollar. I added a star just for the outdoor patio.
1,A couple girls from work get takeout from Los Favoritos multiple times a week. I was invited in on one of their lunches one Saturday and have been hooked since. Everyone is always very friendly and the food is always delicious. Keep it up!
1,"Chuck has been working on my cars since 1981.  For me, that's a whole lotta cars over the years.   Don't let the \""hole in the wall\"" appearance fool you; they know cars, and will treat you like family.  \n\nThe employees have been there forever.  They are prompt and exceedingly honest.  Their pricing is amazing, and if they can fix your car and save you money at the same time, they give you the options in plain English.  When possible, they'll give you the choice of used parts, reconditioned, or new.  If it's going to take a few days to fix the problem, they'll tell you up front.  \n\nYou can count on an honest estimate and top notch service.  And you can always count on a friendly conversation and a laugh or two."
0,"I have had 2 experiences with this company. First was to get a quote for a piece of antique furniture going to a Beverly hills auction house. emails were sent back and forth then suddenly stopped. phone calls were made and were always told that they were busy and would call me back. after a week I got a call back and was told that somehow the emails were suddenly sent to the \""spam\"" file. The second time was when one of their trucks ran into my husbands truck at Turnberry towers and never returned my phone calls or emails."
0,"So after not dining here in a couple months, I decided to give it another chance and took my sister for sushi. \n\nSuch a horrible idea, complete waste of money. \n\nWe ordered 5 rolls between us. The vegas roll (which is usually pretty good) was soggy, the lisa lisa roll was much too sweet, one of the other rolls was fishy and all of them were falling apart. They put everything on one plate, so half the rolls were covered in the sweet sauces from the lisa lisa, it did not mesh well at all.\n\nIt also took a good 25 minutes to get our sushi, when there were only 2 other parties in the whole place. \n\nOn the up side, we actually got a waiter who wasn't absolutely horrible. He wasn't good enough to make up for the meal though."
0,"Save your money\nThe highlight(s) is when Teller performs his illusions alone. Penn is given to dissertations, lectures, explanations, and generally boring banter about what is to happen next. The \""trick\"" is sort of anticlimactical to his banter, which by the way is difficult to understand because he speaks so quickly."
0,"So I bought 1 item. After payment went through I remembered I had a coupon. I asked the cashier Susan if I could use it. Susan said \""but it's done already.\"" I asked if she could void it. So she voids and asks \""so you don't want it anymore?\"" I said that I do but I just wanted to use my coupon. As she is ringing me up again, she tells her coworker next to her \""she's just doing this to get another extra care buck\"". I did not even KNOW that another one would print out. She could've waited til I left the store to talk smack about me instead of me standing 2 feet in front of her!"
0,"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all."
1,"This is some of the best Chinese delivery I've ever had, and I've gotten delivery in Soho, NYC before! A bit pricey for delivery, but after you have a bite you'll know why. Scrumptious! Quick delivery too!"
1,I'm very glad that I can go here to get my lashes done by Cindy... She does a beautiful job. I feel so pretty when I leave the salon...  I highly would  recommend this place and Cindy..
0,"SMALL, sticky, hot, 2 tiny kiddy pools, OVER-priced 50 girls to 1 guy. Not my thing at all."
1,"I'm just writing this review to say what everyone else is saying: Shinbay is EXCELLENT.\n\nThe service is top notch, quick, unobtrusive and suits the atmosphere of this restaurant. Our fabulous waitress didn't make a misstep. I was here for my birthday and they just found out when we walked in, at the end of dinner the whole staff had signed a birthday card for me! What a thoughtful touch.\n\nThe food is incredible. The courses are fresh and original, definitely unique and cutting edge. This is statement food. Every taste was defined and fresh. There wasn't a sloppy dish to be had. It was beautifully presented and some of the freshest I've ever had. \n\nAnd I have NO idea what people are talking about when they say 'strip mall.' Have you even been to some of the stores or restaurants around there? Definitely high end. I get my hair done in this 'strip mall' and it's by far one of the best salons around. I was seriously looking for a strip mall and instead walked into a beautifully lit corridor that opened up to several beautiful restaurants that led straight here. We walked in and the ambiance and the decor was incredibly high end. Must be that affected Scottsdale attitude coming out (live in NYC/DC/Beverly Hills and then stick your nose in the air, please). \n\nThis place is beautiful, the food is like nothing I've tasted here yet and I can't wait to go back. I am addicted!"
0,"I brought my 2005 Honda CRV in because the air conditioner was blowing warm air.  I made an appointment and dropped my car off there because it's fairly close to my sister's house which is where I wanted to wait. Thirty minutes later they called me to ask approve a $48.00 diagnostic check. No problem, I tell them.  1 hour after that they call me to tell me that my air compressor is locked up. I ask what it would cost to fix it.  I was shocked when he quoted me $2235,00 total, parts and labor. When I picked my car up the cashier told me that the compressor was $650.00. The labor is what brought it up to $2235.00. I talked to many friends who suggested I check out either Amazon or EBay for a brand new compressor then take to a local mechanic for installation. BRILLIANT! I purchased a brand new air compressor for my car for $115.00 from Amazon with free shipping. I then took that up to Angel's Auto Repair and they charged me $300.00 to install and that included the freon. I don't understand why Pep Boys charged so much but I appreciate the honesty and integrity from Angel's Auto Repair. My air is nice and cold now!"
1,"Stick E Rice brought a menu by my office and we have literally eaten there since day 1. My favorite item is the orange chicken but I have tried several others and always loved what I ordered. My co-workers have always given the food rave reviews as well. \n\nMy only complaint is that delivery usually takes about an hour but, it's understandable since it seems to be a fairly small establishment. We have however had them throw in extra items if they took a long time."
0,"Save yourself, DO NOT go here!\n\nSee AMber W. - place is empty, you provide a service that results in tips, it's a recession, be lucky you have a job, how 'bout you be a little nicer?!?!?  \nHer review was almost a year ago, well they haven't changed!  \n\nThis is the third time I've been here and each time it's worse!  \n\nMy boyf enjoys the herb crusted burger, it's not bad.  But, to have to put up with sourpuss jerks, NOPE, not fabulous enough!!!  I had a burger, nothing to write home about...\n\nAnd, along with very dismal depressing servers & bartenders, it stinks like a night after a chorus of Englishmen singing rugby songs till morn were there (it stinks every time we've been there), and the wonky unstable chairs, and the not so great pricing, please find a reason why you should hurt yourself by going to this awful dwelling!\n\nThis is a review from three separate spaced apart visits, one lunch, one an event, one dinner, I've earned the right to give this place negative stars, dammit, I can't...!\n\nOh, and by the way, the tots are NOT good x 3!!!"
1,Found them on Yelp and if I could add a sixth star I would.  Quick repair on my son's MacBook Pro (broke the LCD inside but not the screen).  I am great with computers and even repair and upgrade my own but this repair I did not feel comfortable doing.  \n\nPricing was great as well as customer service.  I have 7 computers at home and definitely will use them when things go bad.\n\nThank you!
0,I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.
1,I've been to Roxy's twice this month and so far the service has been consistently ok. I ordered the burger during both visits and thought it was consistent too. The service is great during both visits but much like most Vegas restaurants you feel a bit rushed.
0,"I had these guys install a set of 8000K HIDs for my headlights and foglights.  Upon completion, I found that when turning on the headlights normally, one bulb was out.  However, I was able to activate it by flipping my brights on and then turning them off every time I needed my lights.  I didn't know it at the time but this was a HUGE red flag.\n\nFast forward to less than a year later... my wife and I move out of state and while turning on my car at night to drive home from work, I find my foglights and the one headlight are not working.  I let it go for a while as its the peak season for the industry I'm in and don't have time to bring it somewhere for fixing.  Which would turn out to be my next mistake.  Finally, the inevitable happens... the last headlight goes out.  So... here I am, less than a year after I purchased these lights and both headlights and foglights are out.\n\nI bring it to a local shop to have the HIDs taken out and go back to stock bulbs. They have had the car for a week now because the people who installed it literally cut the wiring for who knows what reason causing me to spend an extra $200 to re-wire my headlight assembly (I didn't have the fix the foglights which I can imagine will be another $100-$200).  \n\nI gave these guys a 1-star only because I couldn't give a \""0.\""  I wouldn't wish the poor service these guys do on my worst enemy."
0,"I ate hear and the waitresses were cute but looked like they were on strung out on meth. The burger was good for the first 2 bites then the taste became very monotonous, I would not go here again."
0,I'm giving this place two stars because I liked the costumer service! The guy was extra friendly. The burger was one that could have been thrown together at home & did not fit the bun & the fries were only so so the ketchup was running and tasted funny.
0,"Great sound as soon as you get through the front doors.  The set up is pretty neat too, general admission standing, with different level floor, so there is good visibility every where.  And if you can manage to get up front you are literally in arms distance from the performers it's sweet! \n\nThe bartenders were super friendly.  I brought in a reusable cup for water and the bartender was nice enough to keep it full of ice and H2O for free all night!  However, if you looking for adult beverages than you better bring a fat wallet with you because prices are out of control!  \n\nAnd although the bartender couldn't have been sweeter and the door security guys were polite and patience, the security dudes inside were NOT friendly which is the reason for the low rating. I understand that they are there to keep the crowd contained for safety reasons but they are a bit over zealous... I mean to constantly harass anyone that accidentally steps over the line that defines the area you can stand in front of the stage when it's a pack show and every one's dancing or reprimanding anyone even leaning on the railing during set break of a 3 hour show is a bit extreme.  I'm all for safety first but they were just a buzz kill.  With ticket prices are high as they are you would hope that your experience would be customer friendly.\n\nHowever, despite to rude security gang I will surely dish out the dough and find myself shaking it down here in the near future because lets face it, they get great bands and I'm a slave to the music."
1,"Wanna get plastered off sweet and girly margaritas by the yard? Check.\n\nWanna be one of those people walking down the strip with their obnoxiously long bottles? Check.\n\nWant extra shots of 151 for $1 each? Check.\n\nWant cheap refills so you can do it all over again? Check.\n\nYou get the idea. There's never any regrets with Fat Tuesdays... hangovers and brain freeze included for free. There are several locations on the Strip but this one inside Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile is the one I frequent the most. Also located inside MGM Grand, Caesar's Forum Shops, Imperial Palace, Mandalay and Stratosphere. Happy drinking!"
1,"Pretty good venue to be at. I am here for a New Years party and the turn out is good for being early still. Nice set up they have here. The VIP sections here are pretty live. They play a variety of music. New and old school hip hop, R&B and top 40 music."
1,"Scrumptious. So many flavors, so little time..."
0,"Where do we start? The place is hot, dusty, very crowded, and so disorganized. Okay that aside, the reason why were giving this event a 1 star ( 0 if possible) is the false advertisement to  various ticket sellers. They proudly say \"" trucks are asked to sell food on low price\"" this is well printed and customer service even answer this question on their website. Well let me save you the precious time, money and save you from getting angry. Not only you have to pay (12) dollars for entrance, you also have to pay parking (5). The websites also says \""trucks will gove samples\"", well were the hell have you seen a place to ask (2) dollars for a sample? Yes! You read that right, samples have prices. Yet this is still not the worst part, when you start to go to their trucks you find out that thr prices are not only expensive it also feels like your getting rip off by the price!!!!! Heres the sample of prices (2 dollars on the following)- eater, soda, 1 minicupcake. (4 dollars) 1 medium size cupcake. (6 dollars) lemonades, shakes, sundaes. 8-16 dollars are the prizes for the maim foods like bbq, burgers, etc. In the end of the day you end up paying 150 ir more just trying foods. With that prize I could have bought a nice dinner and good lunch on a good restaurant. This is not only a rip off, its obviously a misleading event. Oh and did I told you that alot of their foods are mediocre at best? Also some events were cancelled when we went, so unorganized. YeaH WE Will never comeback and will spread the word. Alot of people are still going to it, feels like alot of people dont use yelp ( 2012 was the only event related on yelp). \n\nI hate this event. I really do."
0,"The way I like to make my first judgement about Mexican food is the guacamole. This guacamole was terrible. It was so acidic that  it sizzled on your tongue. Salsas were flavorless as was the rice and beans. I ordered chicken tacos which were fair at best. Chicken was not seasoned and a little dry. We shares a bowl of tortilla soup which tasted so smokey, you couldn't taste anything else. Service was decent for a casual place. Wouldn't come back again"
1,"This place is awesome.\n\nCame here for lunch at about 1:30PM, so it was pretty empty. First thing you notice is the extremely white and sleek decor; I thought this place was like a tech company or something when I was walking in. The staff is really attentive and nice; after reading some of the other reviewers I really don't understand the problems with the service. They have cute little water pitchers and tall, skinny glasses so you never have to go thirsty but you can still have water in a reasonably formal manner. It's a little bit pretentious, I admit, but it worked for me.\n\nI got the gazpacho soup of the day with toasted bread and goat cheese, beet and walnut burger, and cheese curds. How did a carnivore like me manage to order a vegetarian meal? I have absolutely no idea upon reflection, but whatever; it was all good.\n\nThe gazpacho soup of the day was good at best on its own, but that goat cheese was absolutely heavenly; and I've had my share of goat cheeses. Perfect for the warm day that it was.\n\nWho would've thought that the star of the meal was the cheese curds? Not me. But those cheese curds were better than Old Fashioned cheese curds; and that's saying something. Graze cheese curds are massive. There's just something about the bigger size and tangy dill sauce that kept my mouthgasm going on for a lot longer and repeatedly.\n\nThat beet and walnut burger also had some serious flavor. The patty had a surprisingly pleasant texture that definitely didn't really remind me of a normal burger, but it was sweet and fragrant while not being overwhelming. To be honest, it almost acted like a buffer between the other flavor explosions in within the burger. My only complaint was that the bun was loaded with grease (from what, even?? It was literally veggies, some sauces, and the patty), especially the bottom. Oil? I can tolerate, especially in a veggie burger. But having to hold the bottom bun coagulating not because of watery juices, but from oil, definitely took away from the experience.\n\nThe prices were also a touch high here. That walnut burger (alone) would probably have been more appropriately priced at $9, and the cheese curds a dollar or two lower.\n\nBut overall, a really solid place. Come if you're in the vicinity. Good food, good flavors, good ambience, and good service, for high-ish prices."
0,"The tacos were good!!........\n\nNow the problem! We went there to have some good Tequila \""Don Julio 1942\"" @ $25 a shot we were disappointed, not only was it awful it was served in a shot glass. I have had 1942 many times and never has it tasted bad, I mean bad. If you are paying $25 for a shot they should at least serve it in a tequila glass which most tequila bars have.  When we complained (with still 3/4 of the shot left) all they did was some out and show us the bottle it was in. I tried to force it down and almost got sick."
1,"Caribou Coffee on the U Pitt campus is fantastic! Good coffee, comfortable ambiance, and free wi-fi make it a great place to study with a cup of coffee. I love their rustic furniture. You MUST try their cold-pressed iced coffee with a shot of white chocolate. SO good."
0,Stayed at the Wynn for 4 days and came here 4 days in a row. Don't know why my parents like this place so much. Maybe its convenient? I think its way too overpriced. \n\nAlso probably had the worst milk tea here. Boba was hard and the tea was watery.
1,"We order take out from here all the time because it is consistently flavorful and you get a large amount of food for a relatively low price. One of my favorite things to get is the chicken fettuccine, but I order it with red sauce. Its so good and not as bad for you as white sauce. The chicken is good and there are alot of veggies too. My bf is a serious fan of the Steak Rustica sandwich. Their bread is to DIE for as well. I have liked everything that we have ever ordered. It is on our most visited list for sure. May even get it tonight. You should try it."
1,"Friendly service and fresh ingredients are the stars here.  I tried the special for the day, battered cod with 2 sides.  Our waitress explained that the cod was a fresh filet and hand battered.  I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  \n\nService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunny's Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!"
0,"The gym isn't horrible, its actually quite clean. The equipment works for someone who just wants to do cario, or light weight lifting. Locker rooms are nice but I had the most annoying run in with the staff.\n\nI was wearing an small Nike bag, when I was using my cardio equipment, I put the bag over the cardio machine display - it wasn't on the floor nor in anyone's way including myself. An associate came over and told me it's against rules to have bags on the gym floor and in a polite A-holish way, asked me to put my bag in a locker. I didnt have a lock, but I also didn't want to leave since I was on 20 min into my workout so I went to the front desk to the guy who told me I needed to put it in a locker and asked him if I could borrow a lock and he said we don't have any to borrow but you can buy one for $7. It took everything in me not to cuss him out. Like really, you require things to be put in lockers but don't have locks people can borrow. He pretty much kicked me out of the gym because I wasn't paying for a lock and they wouldn't let me go and finish my workout.\n\nI found a gym like 5 min away that I am going to switch to -- I'll let everyone know about the cancellation policy. I heard it's light weight impossible."
0,greasier than most taco shops. \nprices a lil steeper but there is more flavor. \nthe staff had trouble getting my order correct.
1,"Great place for brekkie and people watching in Vegas! Corned beef hash was yummy, great home fries and also good biscuits and poached eggs"
0,"This place does a great job for standard car washes and light cleaning. When it comes to up selling these guys are total jerks. But, if you want to see total unprofessional conduct, up sell hype, and people being total jerks. Come in with a ding or scratch or light crack, or blemish on your windshield. These people will turn into total a crazed meth head looking for a hit!! How many times does it take for them to walk away???? Who knows, you literally have to walk away and hear the hackling from some jerk demanding your insurance information and saying you will get a free car wash. \nThey do great work for car washes, but their up selling and unprofessionalism towards their customers is unreal."
0,Not really used to this Wal-Mart there is not much of selection like the one that I go to. I can say that there is a really nice lady that works in auto area that was so helpful. Oh and a man that works cashier in garden he is really nice too. I may have to come here more often to get used to this one. We shall see.
0,"No personality service, they tried to charge me an extra dollar when I asked for my Thai Iced Tea with no ice (usually places put way too much and my drink is gone in two sips). The fresh spring roll sauce almost make me throw up, I was literally wretching. The food was way over priced for what it was. I ordered three lunches and two of them were supposed to be Thai hot, they were mild at best, very disappointing. Service was dry and lacked friendliness, would not go back.\n\nOh and I bought an eggplant dish and there was barely any eggplant maybe two or three pieces!"
1,"They did an amazing job with my overly furry and shed-tastic corgi.... he got the works (brushing, trimming, nails and teeth) for $45... I was so impressed with the cut...most places don't take the time to make it as perfect as they did and charge more!! I will definitely bring my corgi back here.... they were very nice and kind. They only accept cash or check!!"
1,"This was my second Cirque du Soleil show.  I had seen Ka the previous night.  It was a completely different experience and one more akin to what I feel Cirque du Soleil should be.  \n\nThe show was a great blend of humor with amazing acts of acrobatics and strength.  Prior to the show starting there was a member of the show who came out and pretending to help guests find their seat, only to screw around with them and it made for a good laugh.  The show itself was fantastic.  A lot of acrobatics such as jumping on trampolines and swinging from trapezes.  I enjoyed the humorous parts of the show as well and there was good audience interaction too.\n\nOur seats were pretty good, we were in the upper level, but had a good view of the stage and the acts.  I would go so far as to say almost all of the seats in the house are good except for the ones on the far right or left of the stage."
1,I love this place! I'm vegetarian and get the Falafal wrap at least a couple times a month. I love the it's a smal privately owned place and every staff member has made me feel like a valued customer.
1,With great food and phenomenal service I love having a sugar factory next to us.  Last night we had and amazing dinner with friends.... Best dollar spend on dinner in a long time. Thank you to Sugar Factory staff for the memorable time.
1,"I was lucky enough to be within walking distance to Nova's on my recent visit to Charlotte. Or, maybe unlucky enough. Depending on how you look at it. \n\nAs I walked around Plaza Midwood, I wasn't sure if it was open (the bars on the window don't exactly scream \""WELCOME FRIENDS\"") but when I saw people coming & going from there I figured I'd walk in & see what was what. When I entered there was a big case of shiny pastries, all grinning at me. I felt like a little kid; I could hardly contain my excitement. The nice thing about being an adult is that you can have all the pastries you want, & you really don't have to care what anyone else thinks. With that in mind I ordered a few cookies, a few croissants, a couple scones & a latte. The almond croissant was flaky & tender; I warmed it up in the microwave & the filling melted into the flakiness so perfectly. Blissful. I told myself I was sampling for review purposes, but that was just an excuse to shove a red velvet cookie into my face after having eaten that croissant. It was just okay; nothing to shout about. I think it would have been helped by the addition of chopped walnuts. The latte was solid; it filled my coffee quotient for the morning.\n\nLater in the day I \""sampled\"" the spinach & feta cheese scone. YAAASSS. I warmed it up which made it a bit chewy but still flaky. It was packed with spinach, though I detected less of the feta cheese. It also had a little bit of a kick, provided by red pepper flakes. I had to walk a few miles after eating that scone, but it was so worth it.\n\nThe next morning I told myself I was only going to get coffee and not buy eleventy pastries...but when I walked in, those pastries in that big bright case were grinning at me again. I got a slice of almond tiramisu, a heart shaped mini cheesecake with red jelly-stuff on top, & eleventy croissants. The croissants were splendid, as always. The almond tiramisu didn't taste very almondy, but it was very creamy & the ladyfingers were airy. The cheesecake tasted pretty good (I was \""sampling\"" again) but I didn't eat a whole lot of it, & I scraped off the red jelly-stuff.\n\nAll in all I gave Nova's 4 stars because the service was extremely friendly, the baked goods & treats that I liked were REALLY yummy, and I'm definitely a fan. I'll be back in Charlotte for CIAA Weekend; if you see a curly haired lady with a giant bag of pastries coming out of Nova's, you'll know it's me."
1,"Uhmmm... I think I had a good time? Yea, I think I did. \nWe went on a Wednesday so it wasn't busy which is fine with me. \n\nOur bartender was really friendly, cute and had nice eyebrows (don't ask). We trusted him with making our drinks! The first was a strawberry drink which was deliciousss. \nThe second one? Well I asked him what was in it and all he said was, \""it's grape koolaid\"" (my least favorite).\nI sipped on it... and sipped... and forced myself to finish it.\n\nI would definitely want to go back on a busier night. It seems as though it could get really fun."
1,I knew nothing about guns coming in and wanted to get one for the house.  Craig was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions.  I think I spent nearly an hour going over all of the different options and was never pressured into buying anything.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I'll definitely be a repeat customer!
0,"Our favorite little place is having serious issues :(\nThis place has never been known for cleanliness... But this trip revealed a hair in the food, poor service and bad cooking. I won't be back for a while if ever. \nNot the same as it used to be and I have been coming here for over 10 years."
1,"I liked it, my daughter didn't. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich, she went with the fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tenders (grilled or fried) on a bun with a splot of Hubee D's sauce and pickle slices. Everything is made to order so it does take a few minutes if it's busy.\n\nFries? Excellent and fresh, the right salt. Cole slaw? Good and creamy. Cornbread muffin? Firm and tasty, very good. As for the sandwich, it was quite tasty and I'd absolutely have it again. The chicken was moist and there was enough of it. Several table sauces to choose from if you want to add. The Buffalo was too hot for me but the Hubee D's was perfect.\n\nService was good, though maybe too much. Each time one of the several folks passed by, they were asking if we needed anything. At least five times in fifteen minutes. They could use a \""do not disturb\"" sign on the table.\n\nHubee D's has a big challenge competing in Rivergate with the Chick-Fil-A and McDonald's right nearby. For fast casual, there's also a pizza place, a sub place and Salsarita's. And more upscale includes Friday's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Good luck, folks."
1,"Let me start by saying this:  Malaysian Food is one of the best food in the entire world...and its not because I'm a native Malaysian   ;)  Our food is unique because it draws from our multi ethnic heritage. \nWe had two other Malaysian restaurants before Island Malaysian, which was originally called \""Penang Rest\"". All great except this is the only one that sticks around...so guess that speaks a lot in itself? \nI'm kinda \""consistent\"" when it comes to this restaurant...I order the same few dishes every time...the waitress knows my order but still hands me a menu ...good 4 her :) \n\nWell here are my rating by stars\nAPPETIZERS: \nRoti Canai 5* (small order, get two or three if entr\u00e9e)\nCurry Puffs 4* (potatoes fillings exc flavor, pastry not too bad)\nIce Kacang 5* (my fav, Malaysian style shaved ice ...must try :)\n\nIf you like to feel exotic, get the young coconut drink. Its served straight out of the coconut itself. You will love very exotic ;)\n\nENTREE: \nChar Kuey Teow 5* ( ask for sambal belacan (stinky chili sauce ;) yummmm\n\nHokkein Char Mee 3-4*  (fat noodles, like udon size fried in black sauce. Its very yummy f the cook gets to heat his wok extra hot. Same for char kuey teow abv)\n\nMee Goreng 4* (this is Indian Fried Noodles...back home is fried with some ketchup)\n\nKari Ayam 5* (= malaysian chicken curry. This is the same curry served with Roti Canai) \n\nAnything with Belacan is good if you like the flavor of belacan. But I think just like Durian, belacan is an acquired taste. Its basically chili paste mix with dried shrimp paste. The Thai also use it in their dish. In Malaysia, we eat everything with it. Just as we would ask for ketchup, hot sauce or mayo here, we would ask for belacan to go with most of the dishes @ home. \n\nNOTE: They DONT take credit card --so go to your ATM first.  \n\nI LOVE ISLAND MALAYSIAN ....this is one place I visit at least once or every two months for the past few years since they opened."
1,This was a great experience. Sitting outside you are next to their herb garden where they get the ingredients that they use in their dishes. It's a really nice place and the food is delicious. It's a bit pricey though and the portions could be slightly bigger (for the price).
0,The staff are terrible...they are rude and they are not helpful at all!!!! I will never shop here ever again!!!
0,"It was with much excitement that I stopped in today, their first day of business.  The store is beautiful, as one would expect.  Clean, bright, and plenty of almost eerily happy and helpful staff.  I expect this will all go downhill over time, but for now it's very impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, by the time I left I felt pretty crestfallen that the Meijer I had been so looking forward to isn't going to become a regular stop for me. The main reason for this is because the store is incredibly poorly laid out.   The sections people visit on a typical grocery shopping trip are separated as much as possible, forcing customers to cut through all the home decor, clothes, automotive crap, and the like I'm guessing for the purposes of encouraging unnecessary impulse buys.  Going to Meijer for groceries on a Saturday is enough of a pain in the ass without having to cover every single square inch of the store to get the stuff I need.  Forget a quick trip in to grab a few items for dinner, it's just not possible.  It's so obnoxious that I can't see myself making a lot of grocery trips here since I just don't have the time or patience for a sight seeing tour of every last thing big box retail has to offer.\n\nThe other major issue I had was that the selection was surprisingly limited.  Their organic produce offerings are negligable.  I went in to pick up four particular, and not at all unusual, items and they only had two of them.  It really sucked to hike all over the store for almost 45 minutes looking for what I needed only to find that they didn't have half of it.  What's the point of dealing with a monster store when you're going to have to make a second stop at County Market or Schnucks to finish off  your grocery list?  It's much easier and not that much more expensive to just skip Meijer."
0,"Unimpressed with their customer service.  Had my first real life \""Pretty Woman\"" experience there.  When I came in looking for throw pillows and asked how much a particular pair was, the clerk answered \""expensive.\"" Disappointing, especially since I've been a customer of their sister shops, The Furniture Connector and Southend Trading Co., for years."
1,"Having never had true South Indian cuisine - my date opted for this restaurant. (They also have an extensive vegetarian menu). The food was well spiced, portion size OK and the service was OK. The food was the best part. The dining area was well lit and clean. We would recommend this place and will come again."
1,"To make things simple, foodies should not go to Vegas and neglect to visit this jewel! It's not on the strip, but it is worth the 10-15min commute. Omelets your way...and they are huge and flavorful. The home fried potatoes that compliment your omelette are good, though they pale in comparison to the omelette. Oh, and the banana or pumpkin bread that come with your meal is delicious, as in better than your grandma's (if your grandma could really cook). I got an omelet with shrimp, crab, avocado, and cream cheese with egg whites and it simply blew my taste buds away. Fresh, hot coffee and they keep your cup full!\n\nOld school feel by the ambiance of the place...very homey, rustic and charming. The service was amazing! Server was very attentive, full of recommendations, and worked to meet dietary restrictions of my group. \n\nHands down, 5 stars!! If in Vegas, don't miss out on this breakfast masterpiece!"
1,Tyler has always gone out of his way to make buying cars from him fast and stress free. I've purchased three cars from him in the past 3 years and have been very happy with my purchases.  I recommend all friends and family to world motors.
0,"The service was horrible and the waitress was incredibly rude. The food was average, but for the price, it should have been much better. The $15 burgers my family ordered were undercooked. It took over a half hour to get our food and half the food wasn't even warm when we got it. And $20 for tacos? Give me a break. Don't bother going here.\n\n**Just to follow up, someone who works for the company that owns Chelsea's Kitchen responded almost immediately to this review and addressed my concerns so she could address it with the restaurant managers. Thumbs up on back-end customer service!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. \n\nI went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).\n\nThe presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2\""x 2\""-- a sad display. \n\nThe chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. \n\nThis was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! \n\nWe left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness."
0,"Not great.  Our food took forever and the service was less than stellar, for the price.  This place is way too expensive.  I would much rather drop my money at Wigwam or some other upscale place and be able to enjoy a more romantic ambiance."
1,I feel like a kid in a candy store! The decor is really attractive and everything is clean.
0,Sandwiches over priced and what sandwich place doesn't have mayo only something called dirty sauce.  Waste of time and money.....
0,Normally. Im a robertos enthusiast. But today. Was the day the music died.. the lady working the window was a c.u.next Tuesday. And who the hell puts bell peppers. In a quesadilla. And there carne asada taste like water.. sorry robertos. You score low today :( and that makes me sad.. $25 wasted
0,"We ended up visiting this restaurant one day, after our barista at Starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her 'other job' weren't tipping well, forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant.\n\nSo we show up later that evening.  Anyways, the decor is rustic but outdated.  The menu is limited, and you have no options.\n\n\""What do you mean by no options\"", you ask?\n\nWhat type of salad dressing would you like?  Ranch?  Not a fan of Ranch?  Are you sure?  Because that's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix.  And to spice things up a bit, they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes.\n\nAnd do you like corn on the cob, and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar?  I hope so, because that's all you gonna get.  Sound appetizing?  Sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward  your meaty centerpiece.\n\nMy wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib, which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having, and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth, void of flavor.\n\nI ordered the 'Trail Hand' T-Bone, because I like T-Bones.  You should just call me 'T-Bone'.  Anyways, I asked them to serve it rare, because I had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak.  It was incredibly bland, and destitute of the juice I craved.  It wasn't dry.  More like a raw piece of steak.\n\nWanting to salvage the evening, I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem.  Strike three.  The apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever.  The dough was either overkneaded, or cooked in a microwave.  Kind of stretchy.  A few bites into this, and we knew... prognosis negative.\n\nThis review gets 2 stars, with one of those stars coming from the entertainment.  Yes, the one bright spot was the live music.  The band sounded great.\n\nThis trip turned out to be a complete WASTE of money that would have been better served back at the Seattle Conglomerate."
0,"This place is way over priced and not worth it. I will admit, I've never dined in, only gotten take out, but I've payed out the wazoo and wasn't ever pleased."
1,"This place was better than I expected!\n\nMy friends and I just so happen to do the bachlorette package at the Palms and it was worth it.  Instead of paying a billion dollars for bottle service, we paid $70 a piece and got a decent meal, great service and comp entry to all the clubs at the Palms.  Sooooo worth it.\n\nThe bartenders rocked.  They were friendly and attentive and made great recommendations for how we should play out our night of debauchery.  The Palms (and affiliated clubs) actually made us feel like we got our bang for a buck instead of getting banged for a buck. \n\nLadies I highly recommend looking at the bachlorette option at the Palms.  If timed right, you can wreck shop there and still have time to hit 1-2 more clubs!"
1,It was our first time trying Indian food and I have to say it was AMAZING!! We will definitely be back for the buffet as the owner recommended. The restaurant is beautiful inside and the staff was so helpful. We will be regulars for sure!
1,"I went here last night on my nth visit back to this lovely place. And I realized I hadn't reviewed it here on yelp. So here I am. The first line should explain my stars. This is a perfect hangout place with your friends, a very good date place or a place you could just go for some low key relaxation. And when you are there you have to try the bruchetta. My personal favorites are the smoked salmon and the artichoke but they have a decent variety so mix and match. Last but not the least, it's a wine place so definitely have your glass. This is by far my favorite wine bar in Phoenix. Do visit."
0,So disappointed.  The air conditioner was blowing cold air on all the booths and it took 3 requests to have it adjusted.  Ordered the lasagna and guess what? At 5:30 pm during dinner service no lasagna.  Ordered the meatball sub and it was average.  Meatballs were over-processed with no homemade taste or texture. Ordered a beer and it was not chilled.   Don't think we will be back.
0,"i recently ,like just hung up from this store. they will not take cabinates with out the doors attached , I have a arcadia door with the frame , sink and range hood , lots of hardware and all the parts. \nthey have never seen it and turned me down for getting rid of them ,,I was kinda disappointed as i used there store when i was remoldeling  my kitchchen . oh well check craigs list for a free door  and cubbords ,sink and range hood.."
0,"I wish I knew about this website a few months ago. \n\nMy family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much.\n\nOur reservation was supposed to be at 6:00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7:00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar's forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant. \n\nSkip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star."
0,"Yesterday was my third visit to this location because unlike the other location by the mall, I get great service here. Even when we came on fathers day we had a great time and awesome service.\n\nYesterday I was completely appalled by management...or lack thereof. \n\nWe were sat in a booth, and it was clear they were shorthanded. We were one of about five tables sat at once to the poor two servers on the floor. Our table was one of about five that were sat at once, with a very large party of teenagers and a few more tables coming in after. Therefore, it took a few minutes for us to get greeted. Now, I have worked in restaurants for 16 years, including management and beyond. I know how things run. An older man in a table near us came over and asked if we had been greeted, we said no and he walked away. I assumed he was another customer, and told the waitress when she came over that we realized they just got a huge hit, and wanted to look over the menu anyway so we didn't want to jump on that weird guys bandwagon if he was causing a fuss up front. She said no, he was actually someone from corporate. Ahhh ok. So why would he not get a drink order instead of going off to delegate to people who had not greeted us because they were too busy, causing us to wait an additional five minutes??\n\nSo we order and get our food, and the whole time this man is wandering around, staring at tables with a notebook and making notes. He comes by our table a few times, staring at our empty glasses. Again, the place is slammed and you can see everyone is scrambling around and doing the stupid BBQ presentation at EVERY table. How asinine. You have guests waiting on service but you still insist your servers go through a long ass presentation at every table??? How is that time efficient? \n\nNow since corporate guy is doing nothing to help any situation, I wave him down and ask him since our server is so busy if he could help us out and get us some  refills. I can tell from his face he is not used to being asked to do anything physical. He looked at me like I was on crack, and said \""I will get THE GIRL right away.\"" I was immediately flashed back to plantation days...the girl? Is she going to come over with a poofy white hat and say yessa massa? She is a server. I wanted to walk out at that moment.\n\nHe was DOING NOTHING but still refused to lift a finger to get us refills. Instead, he wandered to find the manager and the waitress to get them to do it. IF you are above pouring a drink in a restaurant, then you should not be working in any aspect of it, if Famous Dave himself is there he better get me a refill. That's GUEST SERVICE. The servers did not need someone to write a note to greet and take care of guests, they know to do that. They needed an extra pair of hands. Standing there and ordering them around is not going to make more servers appear, or make them faster. That's sweat shop mentality. That man should be ASHAMED.\n\nAs a manager in any respect, he should have been helping greet tables. Why would you walk away from a table that has yet to be greeted to try and find someone who is already slammed beyond comprehension? Why would you not greet them yourself? Is it more important to write notes so they know they were busy? \n\nIn the customer service business, no one is above doing anything. A manager should never be afraid to bus a table. There is no reason someone who works for Famous Daves should have walked away from our table without greeting us themselves. There is no reason we should have gotten FOUR rounds of refills on our table because you went and yelled at the manager, the server and someone else. We literally received three waters each and my mom got three cokes. All because one asshat from corporate could not be bothered to lift a finger. THIS is how you run a business? \n\nI hope someone from high up reads this ( I am emailing them as well), and does something because our whole visit was BS. I watched YOUR corporate guy SIT and TAKE NOTES  for an hour and a half on how dissatisfied guests were from lack of service than to TRY and make them happy. SHAMEFUL."
1,I'm giving a preemptive review based on a tour of the hotel and anticipation of staying there next time in Las Vegas.  This hotel is different than other hotels in Vegas as no casino or shopping.  This is an oasis of quiet sophisticated elegance that makes you feel so calm when your surrounded by the chaos of the strip.  You take an elevator to the reception area on the 23rd floor.  As you exit the lift there's a tea area and reception.  We chatted with the concierge  saying we were wanting  to tour the hotel and we were welcomed and they were happy for us to visit.  The hotel is very elegant and as we walked around we visited the pool area.  Very relaxing place and I look forward to staying here.
0,"I am accustomed to drinking coffee every morning from a Bialetti machine that brews a thick beverage. I also enjoy dark roasts--think French roast--so you can imagine that my morning coffee is not unlike drinking tar. When I visit various caf\u00e9s in search of coffee or espresso, I eschew light roasts whenever possible. You see where I'm going with this.\n\nSoy(a) milk in the UK is nowhere near as sweet as what is served in the States for which I am truly grateful. When I sipped my soy latte, my taste buds were greeted with unsweetened soy milk; and yet, there was the strangest second flavor to my latte. I couldn't place the flavor but it was light and almost nutty. Was I served coffee in place of espresso? I'm not sure if Black Medicine roasts its own beans but I was none too thrilled with the flavor profile of the espresso--too light for my tar pit taste buds."
0,"There seemed to be an ownership change happening and the service was awful. My gel cracked off within a week and now I really am at a loss as to where to go. It will not be here, the prices for service exceed the goods received."
1,"So my friend (Jason B.) suggested this place...and I was not convinced by the name...weird images of pot pies out of the movie Sweeney Todd, floated through my mind...I know that is so horrible! Sorry if I grossed anyone out with that! Then to top it off, it was almost impossible to find, because it was so dark! \n\nThe place is long and skinny, and when you sit at the bar you get to watch people make the calzones (for lack of a better word) which is fun! It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!\n\nWe decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy! \n\nWe also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing! \n\nI am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.\n\nBut please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry. Fresh hot out of the oven with jelly sauce....oh my! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! When you go, and you should, don't forget dessert!"
0,I'm going to assume that most of the people posting are fairly inebriated when they write their reviews. I had a chocolate marshmallow cupcake and I was seriously disappointed. The chocolate flavor was lacking and the cupcake was somehow both dry and greasy at the same time. It could just be the flavor combination I selected but I'm sure there are far better cupcakes in Vegas. I just know that I took one bite and didn't have another.
0,"Avoid Avoid Avoid!\n\nEven if you live in Tempe, please drive the extra miles to your second closest Verizon location.\n\nI came into the store with issues transferring contacts from one smartphone to another after I was having issues with Backup Assistant.  I went during an off-period so I did not experience a long wait like most reviewers did.  But, I spent TWO HOURS in the store while associates failed to perform a simple contact transfer from the Backup Assistant/Cloud storage onto my phone.  I ended up leaving with the promise that a ticket had been created and the issue would be resolved shortly thereafter.  But , here I sit hours later and STILL no contacts on my phone.\n\nAfter two hours at home trying to figure it out and two hours in the store, I was very frustrated with my experience with Verizon and wanted to talk to the manager.  Carlos was a grade-A jerk and told me that backing up contacts was my responsibility, EVEN THOUGH I HAD CONTACTS ON MY OLD PHONE AND ON BACKUP ASSISTANT.  He said there was nothing he could do to help me since Backup Assistant is a free service, evidently ignoring the fact that I am a paying customer who just wasted half a day to not even get contacts put on my phone.\n\nCarlos and Co. have succumbed to the belief that they don't have to provide customer service at Verizon.\n\nCAUTION IS ADVISED!"

0,"ANOTHER AWFUL EXPERIENCE! I know shame on me for giving them another chance a year and a half later!\n\nDear Target,  \n My husband  and myself visited your location this evening 1/2/2015 at 8pm. We selected a video game that your employee had to retrieve from behind the plexiglass. We pointed out the one we wanted and she said she would go get a magnet and meet us at the counter. We paid the item, a Pok\u00e9mon game for Nintendo Ds. (A gift for our nephew) After leaving and entering our vehicle my husband began to remove the wrapper halfway then upon inspecting the game realized your clerk had selected the wrong one when she came back with her keys and magnet. Seeing how it had been no more than 2 minutes since we walked out of your store, we were sure your employee would admit to her mistake and correct the issue. Boy, were we wrong. The young woman at the return counter told my husband when he went in that it was \""not her problem\"" he had partially opened the game and all she could do was give him another copy of the same game if she opened it. My husband told me this so I went I because surely this was a mistake. I walked in and there were two women behind your return counter. One large woman packing boxes and the young lady this letter will continue to reference. I asked who had helped my husband and the young woman stepped up. I asked her to explain her policy after telling her the story of your employee's mistake. She once again stated it was \""not her problem\"" that it was open and explained what could be done. I said ok retrieve another copy and open in for me. She got on her head set and radioed for someone in electronics to retrieve a duplicate of the game. After several minutes she informed me that there were \""none left\"" I then asked what she could do for me. She said again it was \""not her problem and there was nothing I could do so.. h well\"" She had a horrific attitude and was being quite snarky. I then asked to speak to her manager to which she snapped \""I am the manager\"" I then asked her to write down her name and her superior's name. (I have bad eyesight) She replied I could \""read her badge\"" and she would not vocalize her name to me. I then asked to speak to her superior, she replied \""I told him there were no managers here\"" A security guard behind the counter walked up and told her to \""let it go\"" clearly trying to calm her aggressive behavior towards me. She radioed for a manager and while waiting she said \""you came in here with a bad attitude miss\"" I addressed her comment by informing her I do not work for target and she does so whether my attitude was bad or not hers shouldn't be so threatening.  Then a woman walked up and told me her name was Marekett she was a manager and asked how she could help. I told her I just wanted her name for reference when contacting cooperate and that her employee there had an awful attitude as I was exiting your store. This security guard and the large woman should be able to recount all of these events assuming they are honest people. I have never met such a rude and nasty woman as this \""manager\""( she claimed) to be working your return counter this evening. I can honestly say she was one of the rudest managers I have ever encountered in my life. So I arrive home this evening with the wrong game, a loss of respect for Target and a mindset to ensure this story is shared in as many places as I can post it to warn others of how unprofessional and standoffish your employees can be. I am sincerely disappointed I your company."
1,"I came here for my 21st Birthday and put together a beer pairing menu for my guests ahead of time. Sage was entirely accommodating and provided absolutely impeccable service. The entire staff was welcoming and professional- I was exceedingly satisfied.\n\nTo begin with we were brought breads paired with supple butter and Australian sea salt- the sea salt was surprisingly a standout addition.\n______\nKusshi Oyster - My favorite of the night, don't miss out on these. Trust ME. Kusshi oysters are some of the best ones around.. incredible.\n\nPacific Yellowtail Crudo- A little bit creamy, but melt in your mouth delicious\n\nI also enjoyed a Glass of  Meursault, Joseph Drouhin, Burgundy (this white wine is phenomenal) & La Fin Dumonde - Perfect with the oysters, a light and refreshing pair\n\n__\nCharred Baby Octopus Caponata- Phenomenal highlight- if you even like octopus, you will Love this one.\n\nSlow-Poached Organic Farm Egg- rich and thick, slow poached perfection\n\nBeer:\nOrval Trappist Ale \nSchneider Aventinus\n\n__\n\nFor our main course we had the Salmon, which was done with classic elegance, a dish involving a type of Manta Ray- which I found to be lacking in flavor and moisture compared to the rest of the meal, and the Lamb Cheeks ( which I recommend ordering Rare -Med.Rare. My fiance liked it more well done but I really wasn't a fan) I drank their Cotes du Rhone Clos du Caillou and Chimay Grande Reserve. Both of these were expectedly excellent.\n\nWe enjoyed two desserts, but the Canelles de Bordeaux easily stole the show, with its waffle crispness and coconut ice cream.\nTripel Karmeliet was a perfect dessert Pairing & the Glass of P.J. Vlackenberg Eiswein, \""Madonna\"" for me as a little extra indulgence was slightly thicker and sweeter than I prefer, but wonderful all the same. Another guest of mine enjoyed the Sauternes from the menu which wasn't as smooth as I was expecting. \n\nEach of the beers had its own special glass in which to pour to bring out each beer's individual notes; as it should be- My guests were especially impressed when a cover for an entree was brought to the table when one of our guests wasn't present as entrees were served. \n\nEverything about this restaurant is phenomenal- from the ambiance down to the luxurious paper our bill was printed on. I could not have had a better experience."
0,"We've been ordering from here for at least five years. The most recent deliveries have taken an excessive amount of time. Tonight we placed the order at 10:25pm. The driver called us at 11:03 saying he was on the 62nd street bridge and asking where we lived in Shaler. The only problem is we live in Lawrenceville... Off of Stanton. It's now 11:37 and still no order. We should have picked it up, I'd be in bed by now. The pizza better be hot, but I have a feeling it won't be."
0,"I'm giving this place one star b/c i have to but it's actually ZERO stars. \n\nIf the following qualities are what you are looking for in a hotel, then this hotel is perfect for you.\n\n- no valet service Fri-Sun \""Lot is FULL\"" all the time\n- hotel guests have to self park Fri-Sun unless you are a Timeshare owner\n- valet did not help us with our bags when we checked in\n- missing hotel items: ice bucket, glasses, extra blankets in the closet\n- we had a coffee maker but no coffee pot\n- stayed on the 51 & 53rd floor but the ice vending machine is on the 50th floor. *shakes head*\n- yellow ice came out of our fridge\n- stains in fridge and dining chairs\n- horrible plumbing!\n- awful customer service\n- inconsistent thermostat, varying room temps in bedroom and living space\n- RUDE front desk, I called for an extra blanket but they said I reached my maximum and was not allowed another blanket. WTF? The guy who answered the phone (named Alex) hung up on me after I said I was cold. Who does that? I called the front desk again and wanted to file a complaint to the manager BUT of course they said the Manager Debbie was busy and that they would have her call me back. Of course I never got a call back or a voicemail. \n\nThis was the worst hotel experience in Vegas or any other hotel I've ever stayed at. I will never stay here or at Planet Hollywood Casino again. They said that the Westgate Towers just uses the PH name for marketing purposes, and that they're not a part of the PH Casino but I don't care. Westgate is giving them a bad name and for that I boycott this place. The only positive thing that came out of this trip was the bigger upgraded room from Adam. He was totally awesome and tried to make our stay better on the first day but it just went down hill from there. Our large room is not worth all the f'ed up shit we had to go through. And on top of all the BS, they tried to sell us timeshares! WTF? are you srs? How does a hotel expect to sell timeshares when they treat their hotel guests like second class ppl???"
1,"APD is not only the best paintball shop in Arizona but one of the best anywhere in the southwest/west coast. Matt and Jon are the best guys around, super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and the prices are always fair. The fact that they have been here for nearly 12 years says it all - no matter where you are in the valley this place is worth traveling for."
0,Horrible service and overpriced drinks as well as crappy food!! Won't be coming here again! Beware they'd rather put crap on their tvs than the pittsburgh pirates game even after we requested to watch baseball game! Don't waste your time go to Jerome Bettis!
0,"food was good - service horrible.\n\n1. appetizer was served with no plates, crumbs were all over the table. \n2. finished sandwich and had very few fries left on the plate and the waitress actually comes back to offer ketchup....\n3. drinks were refilled but the empty ones did not get removed, cup rings all over.\n4. waitress drops the receipt & pen on the table lethargically - usually wouldn't care to notice but hard not to notice when it makes a thud - great last impression, with a messy, wet and crumb-y table.\n\nonly going back for to-go."
1,"Went today for an oil change. Was greeted by Phil the manager. Very nice, knowledgeable manager. I used a coupon that included a free inspection with the oil change for $17.99. I wanted to know how my brakes were since I've had my car for 8 years and never replaced brake pads. He said it would be completed in an hour, so I went shopping at Home Goods and had lunch at Jimmy Johns. I like this Midas location because it is in walking distance to these shops. I came back in an hour and Phil updated me on everything. He was very honest and said my brakes were at 50%. I mentioned I was told by Meineke my struts were leaking and if he could check those while the car was on the lift. He brought me out and showed me where they were leaking. I like the fact that he didn't give me the runaround because I'm a woman. He understood I'm interested in how my car is working and took the time to explain and show me the struts. He typed up a very reasonable quote for a brake fluid flush and strut replacement. Their prices are cheaper than Meineke. Because of Phil's wonderful customer service, this is my new go-to place to take my car. The waiting area is very comfortable, unlike Jiffy Lube where I usually go, and end up paying double the amount for an oil change."
0,"I must say that the food is great at Sushi Bomb. The problem I am having is with the service. More than once we have been treated like we are lucky to be eating there as opposed to them being happy we are their customers. We eat there at least twice a month, but its starting to get to the point where we no longer enjoy going there.  Not sure if management is aware of what is going on.  Like I said good food, not so good employees."
1,"I love this place! Since the first time I walked into this deliciously urban coffeehouse, I have been greeted by name by Jeff, and his awesome staff.\n\n Last Tuesday, I stopped in to get snacks for a Birthday Brunch at the office at like 6:30 am. I purchased an entire quiche, just out of the oven and it was the hit of the party as this quiche was ridiculously FABULOUS!!  \n\nJust say yes to this place!"
1,"I was so excited to see this new Paradise Bakery  so close to home. \nNot only is on the way to many things we do and a Super Target  it is near my husband's work , so we technically could act like we are meeting him for dinner but really just want Paradise.   \nSo far the food here seems to be still being fined tuned. On the day we \nstopped in they seemed to be inconsistent in portion size  and service. But I have faith in them that will soon have that figured out! \nThis is a super place to meet for lunch or have a bite to eat away from work ."
0,"melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor, if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right,  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger, all were cooked correctly and tasted good, the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward, the bok choy side consisted of one leaf, must be running low.  Dessert was ok they did a great job making scratch creme brulee taste like instant and the pineapple thingy was the high light of the evening, if I was headed home from a winning time at the casino and my car broke down out front I would think about stopping in for a bite"
0,Worst pizza I have ever had.  I could have done better with something from a gas station .  They do not get orders right.  The chocolate cake is gross!\nGo get a food from 7-11. You will do better.\nRip off pricing for what you get.
0,"A couple years ago I had taken my 2003 Ford E-250 van that I was washing before putting it up for sale. I took it through the wash and when they were done wiping it down, the glass repair guy who was affiliated with this car wash told me I had a crack in my windshield. I drove this van every day and knew there was no crack, but I thought there might be a possibility that it may have happened that day and I just did not notice this dime sized crack right in front of my face.\n\nSo the kid from Romania told me he could give me a great deal at $80. I told him no that i was selling it and I was not going to spend a penny more on it. He did not want to lose money so he brought it down to $60, then $40, then $35. I repeated that i would not spend money on it. He gave me an offer of $25 so I accepted and told him that i would use him in the future if I have any windshield repair work.\n\nWhile he was repairing my windshield he realized I was a locksmith and asked me if  I would make him a key to his mid-90's Honda Civic. I remembered it very well with super dark tint, primered and appeared it would was being prepped for painting. \n\nWhen he finished he asked me for my name/number/ADDRESS for the invoice. I found that odd since I was paying cash. He assured me it was standard policy and I would not receive spam calls or mail.\n\nA week later after I purchased my new Chevy Express van, I was in the front of my house and noticed this same kid driving his Honda Civic by my house that appeared to be looking for an address. He came to a stop 1 house past mine and looked at me and then took off abruptly.\n\nThe next day I was on my way to a job and noticed a crack in the windshield on a van with less that 200 miles on it. Immediately I suspected this kid from Romania who also works with a bunch of family members that own the company. He must have done it at night under the cover of darkness.\n\nI called the 16 st location and revealed my suspicions who in turn told me to call the owner at another location. When I spoke with the owner he thought it was the most absurd thing he had ever heard. He conveniently disconnected from the call and when I called back it went to voicemail.\n\nI had a large credit on my prepaid card so I was going to use it and had gone back for another wash and spoke with the manager. I told her my story and she assured me she knew this family and that she trusted them and that they would never do such a thing. I had no proof so I could only argue my case to a certain extent without sounding crazy.\n\nThe next time I had gone back the Romanian kid was there and I was cleaning the mess out of the cab so it could be vacuumed. I was throwing everything valuable in a  plastic bag to sort out later and had a trash can to throw the junk away, so I know this kid never examined my windshield.. I WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM DOING SO..\n\nThe kid walks up from behind the back of the van and told me that I had a crack in my windshield. I just glared at him for about 5 seconds without saying anything and told him not to worry about it. There are two things that made this kid guilty. 1) like I mentioned before I would have seen him examining the windshield if he did. So the ONLY  way for him to know if there was a crack is if he did it himself. 2) If he had examined my windshield he would have noticed that it had ALREADY BEEN REPAIRED. That's how I know for sure he did it, but still I had no proof.\n\nI had let my van go a couple months without washing it and the next time I came in I asked a random worker what happened to the Romanian (windshield  repair) family. The worker told me they were being watched due to other customers who were suspicious and that he was caught with a spring loaded punch cracking a windshield. So the owner let them go....\n\nAfter all that you would think they would apologize and give me some credits to make up for it, but they did not.\n\nThe last straw for me was when the Ultimate car wash did not appear to give a wax coat along with the appearance of the machine and worker not doing a thorough job of cleaning. When I asked if I could take it through again the kid gave me a hard time.  After taking it through a second time I noticed bird dropping that were still there so I just took it upon myself to finish the job myself.\n\nI'm glad I only have a few dollars left on my prepaid card. Since I have no reason to go back, I will be finding a new car wash from now on."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! The salon was a joke!!!! The girl had no personality what so ever, got color all over my face and then tried to charge me an extra $10 cause my hair was longer, why don't you just mix up enough color the first time when you saw how long my hair was. This girl didn't say two words in over 2 hours, aren't stylists supposed to make conversation and be friendly especially since they work off tips?? You would think so but nope! I will Never be back!!!!!!!!! Not to mention the $25 coupon that they have on their website doesn't apply to the $55 for the cut color and style here but when I went to other ultas they did accept the coupon. It was one thing after another! I will never return!! horrible experience from start to finish"

0,"Interesting experience.\n\nRooms are clean and simple.\n\nCasino floor, riddled with robotic people, staring at the slot machine wheel, ashtray overflowing.  \n\nHeaded from my room,  saw what appeared to be police officer come out of a room, accompanied by uh...a rather interesting woman.  Rode the elevator down, and it turned out to be a hotel security guard with a prostitute.  He was boasting about himself, mentioned a chap named Jose who hooked them up eith the room. \n\nLater while killing time at the bar, the lady of the night was trolling the bar for clients.\n\nSo, the good news, Boulder Station requires thorough \""back\""ground checks on the prostitutes....so you should feel safe in that regard.\n\nDoes housekeeping know that the rooms are being used for trysts....or are you lying in a bed of recent fornication.   \n\nEnough to keep me away in the future for sure."
1,"Food is the same as at every Wingstop in America, but that's not a bad thing - consistency is nice in a chain location.  That said, the highlight of this Wingstop is the service! I was amazed at how friendly and willing to help the staff were. By far better than many sit down restaurants I have been to. Go here and eat in just for the wonderful service."
1,"Service was great, excellent steaks right the way we wanted them and the atmosphere was fun. This place fits right into upscale Vegas."
0,The service was lousy. Server kept scratching her armpits and body without washing her hands and served foods minutes later.
0,Fun atmosphere!  Nice menu selection. David the waiter was great.  Drinks are huge but don't taste much alcohol!  Better Mexican places...
0,The decor has got to go..or at the very least wipe down all the dust..  I have to say the food was good not great but good.. The staff all seems to be in some other world though. So depressing all of them like they hate their jobs.. What a way to start my morning.. MANAGER if you are reading this I would say a cleaning day is in order.and something to boost the moral of your employees..as I saw you yourself acting the same way just depressed. All that feeds of to your customers.. I well give this place another chance and hopefully the experience will be different..
1,"I recently had an emergency trip I needed to take.  As I was going home to pack I noticed I was getting a flat tire.  I stopped at our local Big O, told them my situation and they had me on my way in under 30 minutes, at zero cost.  It was a FANTASTIC service."
1,"Absolutely go here for a meal.  Sat at the bar.  Bartender was lovely, entertaining and could make a great drink.  That evening it was a negroni punch.  He recommended the pork chop -- it was the size of my head!  Cooked at medium, it was tender, juicy, succulent...can't say enough about it except next time, bring a friend a share!  The slaw was delicious and had the right amount of acidity and freshness to cut thru the richness of the pork chop.  Nom nom nom!"
1,"The BF and I came for lunch. \n\nHe ordered the Fat Greek Gyro w/ fries. He thought it was pretty good and surprised at how plentiful the meat was. Fries were crispy outside and still fluffy inside. He originally wanted to get falafel but they were out, so next time.\n\nI got the chicken shawarma w/ Greek salad. The chicken was pretty juicy and the hummus in it was good and plentiful in meat and toppings. Salad was pretty basic, but very fresh and crisp. \n\nWe got a baklava to share since it just got out the oven. This would have been pretty good of a pastry but the nuts tasted a little bit burnt so it was toasted a bit longer than it should have been. \n\nService was friendly, but a bit slow. This though wasn't because the server wasn't doing his thing, but he was the only server with two big parties and 3 other tables. There were other people prepping and who I think is maybe an owner sitting around, but no one helped him out. \n\nOverall a pretty decent lunch spot."
1,One of the better places to get a steak-n-cheese... it's just pretty expensive
1,"East End is a brewery, not a restaurant. Don't expect to sit down for pizza and brews. Most of the space is filled with brewing equipment - tanks and such. What you can do is sample a bunch of beers, and walk away with some.\n\nIt's a challenge to find East End. There's no sign. Just an open door in a brick warehouse. And an empty keg sitting outside. Our first time, we didn't think we could possibly be in the right place. Until we saw people leaving with beer.\n\nYou can only visit during growler hours. Inside there's a low bar straight out of high school chem. You can sample the eight or so beers on tap. And chat about the beers or anything else. And be impressed at how many people manage to find the place. The beers are tasty.\n\nThen when you're ready, pick a beer or two to get a growler of. A growler is a half gallon jug they filled from the tap. They also usually have a special beer or two in bottles. Typical brewery swag is also available - pint glasses, t-shirts, etc., to prove that you actually found the place."
0,"Meh.  Sports bar.  Worse, a sports bar chain.  The outdoor patio was more attracitve, even if was part of the mall's covered car park.  I don't tolerate the smell of stale beer.  That's what greeted me at the inside podium.  There's bar food on the menu, of course.  Fried next to more fried stuff.  Come here after work and throw down some beers.  That would be fun."
0,"My family LOVES Thai food.  When we stepped through the door for the first time at Pin Kaow this past week, we were in awe of how cozy and beautifully decorated this restaurant was on the inside.  Here is what we ordered (our Thai favorites) and the consensus we came to on our overall experience:\n\n1. Tom Ka Kai soup ( A lemongrass soup with coconut milk, mushrooms , and chicken)\nIt was rich and delicious with just the right balance of flavors..  but extremely salty.. so much so we could not finish.  Had it not been so salty.. I think it would be the perfect soup.\n\n2. Nam Tok Salad (Grilled sliced beef, mint leaves, onion, basil, Thai spicy sauce)\nWe normally fight over the last portion of beef salad, but none of us cared too much for this particular salad.  Again it was overly salty and the portion was quite small.  Maybe a different salad would have suited our taste better, but there was something a bit overpowering .. not sure what.\n\n3. Chili Mint Noodles (Stir fried flat rice noodles, onion, chili peppers, jalapeno, basil leaves, egg, and your choice of meat (we chose shrimp)\nI would have enjoyed eating more of this, but there just wasn't enough of it because they were so stingy with the portions.. noodles don't cost very much.. \n \nWe've decided to keep looking."
1,Omg best place ever. My hair looks great. She helped me with great great products for my hair and other stuff.... I'm happy that I found someone who I can trust with my hair. Thanks for helping me.
1,"Yes, they put the pizza together and then you cook it at home. I know, that's weird. You'd think it would affect the quality, but it doesn't. The ingredients are fresh, the choices are plentiful and the price and quantity you get is very high. \n\nThere's a reason Zagat has rated this the best pizza chain multiple times, and there's a reason people listen to Zagat and not random biased reviewers who only get noticed by virtue of writing the first review. \n\nPapa Murphy's gives you quality food for a good price and you don't even have to deal with waiters, seating, or any of the trappings of a normal restaurant environment. It's a low key good quality experience."
0,"I have gone to Nail Bar Spa several times for pedicures and have always been pleased with the results.  However, on my most recent trip there, the male technician doing my pedicure started laughing and speaking to the female technician next to him in another language.  At that point the female laughed too, pointed at my legs, and let me know they were laughing because I am \""too white\"" and kept going on about how pale I am.  I am a natural redhead, so of course I have pale skin that does not tan.  It made me feel very uncomfortable that they would be so unprofessional and rude.  I didn't feel it was at all appropriate to make fun of a customer, to their face, about the color of their skin.  I will not be back to this location ever again, which is a shame because they do a good job and are very convenient to where I live, but I would rather drive a little further to be treated better."
0,"H O R R I B L E !!!!!\n\nWant a good \""quality\"" hotel? Don't go to this one. It's the worst hotel I had ever stayed at. The service is awful; from the main desk to house keeping, there was 0% percent of effort and care for the customers and the hotel itself. There was a short supply of everything at the hotel, especially towels! Customer courtesy? None. Rude and snobby front desk manager and the rest of the staff didn't care about the privacy of the customers and sanitary needs of the room. Also, the smell of vomit was VERY present and air conditioner system of the hotel was broken. House keeping was difficult to communicate with, hence the lasting vomit smells. The manager didn't do ANYTHING about it either. The breakfast is terrible as well (risk of salmonella) and the food is not fresh. Please save yourself from a nightmare of atrocities, do NOT stay at Quality Inn."
0,"I would give this place one star; however, the decor was nice and the location is handy for a \""dinner and a movie\"" night. (but not handy enough to warrant coming back.....)\n\nThe prices were alright, I would expect things to be a little cheaper based on a few things though:\n.The food was mediocre to bland\n.The ordering at the counter, yet having a \""server\"" rushing around tables\n like he was in some sort of relay race is just obnoxious.\n.No one welcomed us upon entering, after a couple minutes someone\n asked if we were ready to order or if we needed to look at the board\n longer\n\n1/4 way through our experience here, we felt like we had already been ripped off.  The food really was nothing exciting at all.  The place itself appears to be in some sort of identity crisis. I mean is it counter service or sit down? You can't be both, it just annoys people.\n\nMeh. My opinion...skip it and just fill up on popcorn or leave early for the movie and go some place else... perhaps with flavor and an identity.  Just a thought."
1,"The best indian food I have ever had. The service is always amazing. I come here on a monthly basis and it is always consistant. When we crave traditional indian food, we come here!"
1,"If you look up gourmet pizza in the dictionary, Pizzeria Bianco's pizza choices would be staring back at you.  This was some of the tastiest pizza of it's kind that I've had in some time.  As a native of Chicago, I am an open minded pizza lover (I mean I, of course, am a bit biased when it comes to deep dish pizza) but I LOVE pizza and especially love trying different types of toppings, crusts and sausage.  Pizzeria Bianco was all it was cracked up to be (however, I would NOT wait hours to be seated as I've heard is how things go at the downtown location...it's not THAT awesome, lol!)  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is really casual and nice- especially on the patio on a nice 80 degree evening :-)  Will be visiting again and again!"
0,"WORST place I have ever been to!!! The service was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We got there after a few of our party who already ordered & when we were met by the idiot waitress after 15 mins of being there we FINALLY are able to order drinks & the others get their food. We were only about 5 mins behind the other people in the party. After another 10 mins just to get drinks we try to order. I ask if there is a small burger for my 6 year old & I am told they only have big burgers & NOTHING for kids. So I ask my daughter about other items on the menu & what she wants after a few mins then our idiot waitress then informs me they have a kids menu with kids sized food.. even though she JUST told me they do not serve kids sized food. I order nachos with no onions & pico. Just to get my food & have onions in the beans. When I ask the idiot waitress about the onions in the beans she replies '' ooohhh ya, I guess I should have told you there were onions in the beans since you didn't want any\"" I send them back & order a pita with melted cheese. We get out bill & the nachos I SENT BACK & DID NOT EAT were still on our bill. The idiot waitress says '' ummmm well I just kept that on there & didn't put the pita & cheese on there\"" I say \"" ummm there is a difference in price...\"" she says\"" umm well do you want a $5 gift card?\"" I tell her I am never going to go back there so that wont be necessary. If you want GOOD service DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!"
0,"Crowded, did not have enough seating or parking. Qdoba down the street has way more menu options and much nicer staff. Over all not impressed with Chipotle."
0,"Really expected more from the bellagio! There was nothing special about this buffet. It felt smaller than the other buffets I have been to in vegas. My first plate I got mostly breakfast things and didn't eat any of it, just dry and bland. Ribs and prime rib were the only thing that stood out as memorable. But I went back for more and they were gone. Desert was not great. We opted for the $12 extra unlimited drinks and that was a great value for me since I was getting mimosas but the margaritas they were serving didn't taste like they had any tequila in them at all. I would recommend spending the extra $20 or so and go to wicked spoon."
0,I have certainly had worse dining experiences. The service while not really existent is at least not rude. I will say that the portion size for a $23 Combination Pan Roast is the worst I have ever seen.
0,"Terrible service experience. After waiting 20 minutes with no wait staff acknowledging our presence, we began to wonder if this was a self-service restaurant.  The place was less than half full and still not one person stopped by our table to help us. Pizza is ok but is absolutely not worth the hassle."
0,"I know this place has good reviews, and maybe some people have found this place helpful, but if you have a serious problem I really suggest going elsewhere. I never write reviews, which should tell you just how horrible this place is...\n\nAbout a month ago I got a UTI (first one in my life).  I found this place online, read good reviews, called to see if I could make an appointment, but they only take walk-ins so I went right down.  The front desk is very short with you and rude, which I didn't really care at first.  I filled out the paperwork and only had to wait about 10 minutes before they took me back to take my blood pressure, my weight, and then a urine test.  I waited in the room for a couple minutes before the doctor came in.  We only spoke for a couple minutes and then he prescribed me antibiotics and a pain reliever.  I took the antibiotics for a week and my UTI seemed to have gone away.  A month later I started getting the same pain again so I assumed I had gotten another UTI, but I was out of town so I called Legacy to see if they could call in a prescription to a pharmacy where I was.  They said no and that I had to come back in for another consult since it had been a month since my last visit.  I went back in 2-days later when I was back on town... Same process, weight, blood pressure, urine test.  I waited a couple minutes in the room and then a different doctor came in to speak with me.  She was nice, as was the previous doctor, she talked about her trip to Australia rather than discussing my UTI.  She then asked if I had an STD and I told her no, that my boyfriend and I have been living together for over 6 years, and then she asked me if I was sure he wasn't cheating on me.  Not exactly what you want to think about when you're trying to get treated for a UTI.  She then told me that this was most likely a continuation of the first UTI I was treated for a month ago and that the antibiotics the first doctor had prescribed for me doesn't typically work for UTI's.  I asked her why he would prescribe an antibiotic that is known not to work and she just said \""I don't know\"".\n\nI've been taking the new antibiotics for 7-days and with 3-days left to go the pain is worse than ever.  I called today to try to figure out what I should do and the front desk, who are all very rude and unhelpful, told me I had to come back in for another consult before they could prescribe a different antibiotic for me. After getting transferred around 4 times, and getting hung up on twice, one of the receptionists finally said she would pull up my chart and speak to a doctor and call me back.  Several hours later when I hadn't heard from them I called back, was placed on hold for another 10-15 minutes, hung up on again, and then finally Raven came on the line and said that I needed to come back in for another consult.  I told her I had just paid for 2 office visits, 2 urine tests, 2 different antibiotics, 2 pain relievers and that I was not going to come back in and pay for another consult & urine tests since I had just taken one a week ago.  I then asked her why the second doctor had told me that the first antibiotic doesn't typically work for UTI's and asked why they would still prescribe it to me anyway, she said the doctors I spoke with were just PA's and it's just their personal opinion and that I hadn't actually seen a doctor. She then told me again that I would need to come back for a consult to get a new antibiotic prescription.  I was very upset by this point and on the verge of tears from the pain and told her I was absolutely not going to come back in and pay for another visit and urine test and that I wanted to speak to a doctor right away.  She placed me on hold for another 20 minutes, then came back on the line and said the doctor wanted to prescribe me a new antibiotic and pain reliever.  I told her I was already taking that specific pain reliever and that it wasn't helping and she just said, \""Well, this is a higher dosage and it should work\"".  I said I was already taking the higher dosage and it was not working.  She then said that's all she could do for me.  I just gave in and let her call in the prescription to my pharmacist.  When I got to the pharmacy the pharmacist was on the phone with Legacy Urgent Care about my prescription because they prescribed me an antibiotic that contains penicillin WHICH I AM ALLERGIC TO! Luckily the Pharmacist knew my allergies and called to double check the prescription.  When she got off the phone with Legacy Urgent Care, they had told her to just go ahead and prescribe it to me anyway, even knowing my allergy to penicillin.\n\nI am very sorry I ever went to Legacy Urgent Care and spent the amount of $$ just to be prescribed antibiotics that don't work, and ones that I'm allergic to.  This urgent care is only about getting you in there for consults to charge $80 per visit, plus $8 for urine tests... Please go somewhere else if you can and don't give them your hard earned $$."
0,"My husband and I recently went to Roy's while staying at the JW.  I had read the other reviews on Yelp, and thought it would make for a nice evening.  What a complete disappointment!  The food was NOT good, and the price tag only made matters worse.  I had the blackened ahi, which was served with a lump of flavorless, cold white rice.  My husband, who is not a fish eater, went for the chicken breast, which was also cold and remarkably bland. \n\nLuckily, the meal was preceeded by a nice, strong martini, and excellent service, which is the only reason this review is landing two stars instead of one."
0,"Not sure about the other locations, but the one in Ballantyne is horrendous. I mean one of the biggest cluster F's I've ever experienced in my life. They refused to seat us at a 2 top table in the outdoor area because a \""party\"" was coming which NEVER came the 1.5 hours we were there due to terrible service. We were sat in the middle of the floor at a high top table and waited 10-15 min just for drinks. Ordered the mild wing appetizer to which the server said \""we don't have mild\"" and which was clearly stated on the menu. Once bringing this to her attention the response was \""oh\"". My wife ordered a Mr. Pibb and the server said \""what is that, I have never heard of it\"". Uh, take a look at your soda machine like my wife did and you will clearly see Mr. Pibb as one of the options which is also clearly stated on the menu to which the server said \""Oh, I\""ve never heard it called that\"". My wife specifically said Mr. Pibb because that's what they serve so I guess what it really says is that for our first time eating there we knew more about the drinks and menu option then our server did. The wings were horrendous with zero flavor and came with no dipping sauces and we ordered 1 ranch and 1 blue cheese. Another server realized this and kindly brought us what we ordered. 20 min after that our server finally came and took our order and when it came out she brought us the wrong pizza so we waited again for the correct one. We asked for utensils 3x and the restaurant said they \""ran out\"" but again, another server kindly brought us some because our server couldn't seem to be bothered by bringing us any. This is after she tried to leave dirty appetizer plates that we had used for wings on the table and tell us to use those for our dinner. So to sum it up, long wait for food, incorrect order, no utensils, no napkins or plates, wrong order when it came out, incompetent server and manager who also couldn't remember jack crap, and food was bland and definitely not worth the wait or the $$$. I mean it starts at the top, so if the manager can't manage the restaurant herself then that explains the cluster for the rest of the restaurant. The manager asked us 20 min after we received our wings if they had ever came out, then we asked her for utensils and of course she didn't remember to bring any so what was the point. Do yourself a favor and don't let the \""cute little patio area\"" draw you into this disaster of a so-called restaurant. There are plenty of others in Charlotte to choose from."
0,"In a word: forgettable. This is AZ, you can get better mexican fare on any corner. Largely bland and uncreative, food was just ok. Service was good, food was more than it was worth."
1,"Love Love Love this theater/ Lucky for me it is very close ..Its like a quiet retreat theater. Always very clean, and let me talk to you about the comfortable seating. Lately there has been some very LONG movies, and there seating is so lush and wonderful. You can get a glass of wine or a beer also. Very adult type theater. I would score this a Full Five Stars. In fact--going back today!! Try it..you won't be disappointed!"
0,Absolutely the longest I've ever waited for a sandwich.  Not worth it. Skip this place. Its seriously like they start planting the grain when you order the bread.
1,"This place is legit!  Who knew I would hit  the jackpot discovering  this Hawaiian restaurant in a small strip area of downtown Henderson. They just opened about a week ago. \n\nService -  Very friendly and attentive. It took a little time for our order to come out, but hey it is a Hawaiian joint on Hawaiian time (wink) Our server did come by to let us know the status while we waited. \n\nAmbiance -   The ambiance gave off the Aloha vibe with the paintings and music of Hawaii. It could use a lil spit shining  though (like store windows w/o fingerprints and carpets cleaned) but that's just me being real nit picky\n.\nFood -  Well you better make sure when you come here you are REAL hungry!! They serve you enough food to feed 2 people! Seriously!  Their menu offer some of my fave  comfort foods of the islands..Loco Moco, Kalua Pig, Chicken Katsu, Saimin, Teri Beef, different plate lunches and even Korean style beef plate.\n\nI ordered their signature Saimin dish called the The Islander. Check out the pic I took..cause the presentation of my dish was a Yelp worthy photo!   It came in the HUGE bowl, looked more like serving bowl to me, but the owner said that was the regular size.  He said they there was a bigger size than what I had.   The Saimin was steaming hot, noodles are made fresh, the broth spiced just enough, portugeese sausage was grilled,  fried egg, and napa cabbage was a great touch to this delish dish.   You could also add potstickers or fried coconut shrimp for extra fee.  I loved every drop of my noodle soup!  Couldn't finish it though and NOTE: the Saimin is only available for dine-in, since they do not have the right packaging/containers for this amount of soup (that's what I assume)\n\nMy husband ordered the large \""Ali'i\""  mixed plate of Teri beef and Kalua pig...and I kid you not it was the largest serving of mix plate dish Ive seen around here. Big portions of both beef and Kalua pig.  I tasted a little bit of Kalua pig and it was very tender and tasty, like the local places I had over on the islands.  Pretty sweet we have ono grinds on this side of Henderson now.  These guys do Hawaiian food right.  I cant wait to try the other dishes on their menu."

0,"The ladies that are on the kitchen appliances seem like they work on commission or sales .. They were all nice and everything when I need help choosing things , but once we had a problem at the register they all scattered like roaches .. Nobody was around to resolve the problem I guess the sale didn't matter then .. Very very disappointing since this is the closes store next to my city .. Even one of the girls was giving me a dirty look for not going with her for the sale.  Whatever Happen to good ol customer service.."
1,"The bar here is lively and really comfortable.  Large high top tables have very comfortable chairs, unlike most bar room high tops.  Service was good, as was the food.  I could have done without the live music, but that's a personal preference.  We'll be back for sure."
1,"Good place to pick up a nice essential piece to build outfits around. The sale rack is your friend, it's worth taking five minutes to flip through it. Employees are attentive but not pushy, which frankly, I'd rather be ignored until I'm ready to purchase something, but as long as they're not breathing down my neck, I'm good."
1,"You can't really beat this theater for a great movie experience.  Here's what you need to know:\n\n1.  You park in the back (I believe its off of 24th st).  Get a ticket from the parking garage and then have it validated before you leave.  The parking is free!\n2.  If you exit the parking garage on the 1st floor, you need to take the escalator up to the second level.  This threw me off the first time.\n3.  You can purchase your ticket and reserve your seat head of time!  This is great for opening weekends.\n4.  There is a full menu and drink list.  I'm still a sucker for the popcorn though!\n5.  Saturday afternoons are more inexpensive than evening shows - something to keep in mind if you are on a budget!\n6.  The seats are big & comfy and have a little side table for your food drinks!"
1,The pasta was amazing and the people were extremely friendly.  Try the iced tea!
1,"I was pretty sad to see Foskoskie's close, but glad something new took it's place. At first glance, not much changed - they still have the awesome oak bar when you first walk in, and rightfully so. The bar is a historic piece of the building, when Pike's Soda Shop (yes, that one) was in this location and still connected to Pike's Pharmacy (yes, there is a relation). The honey pecan chicken from the Foskoskie's menu is still there, and still amazing.\n\nI'm enjoying the sorta-southern, sorta-creole combo going on. They do the genres justice with good food that's not overly complicated. To quote the owner, \""We know we're not a fancy date night place. We're a neighborhood restaurant where you can bring your girl for a burger and a beer and just unwind.\""  The owner, by the way, is incredibly friendly and will remember you when you come back. I love it when the staff makes you feel like a friend visiting.\n\nThe special of the day is usually a great choice, and the \""neat loaf\"" (vegetarian meat loaf) is pretty dang good, too. As others have said, they price half-size portions on the menu to keep things in check. Other restaurants - take the hint.\n\nIt's good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the prices are right. We've made Letty's our weeknight out, call up some friends to grab a bite at the last minute place. Every neighborhood needs their \""down the street\"" place and I'm glad this is mine!"
0,"This place is not what it used to be. When they opened, the food was wonderful, the wine amazing and all this at a very affordable price. Now the food is barely ok, the wine is basic and the prices increased by 30%. Really not worth it. If you are looking for affordable and very tasty and authentic french food, you're better off trying Scratch with their dinner menu. If you are looking for a more fancy French restaurant, Vincent in Phoenix would be the place."
1,"Now I'm a stickler for food and great service. Visiting Montreal for the jazz fest and met up with several friends for dinner here. One of the friends who has been here many times suggested this place.\n\nAbsolutely stunning food and impeccable service. We were 9 of us including 2 vegetarians. We all shared the food and I have to say, everything was fresh and full of flavor. So many dishes that I can't describe.\n\nService too was very slick. Our glasses of water were never empty in spite of the restaurant being full. When appetizer plates were taken away, so were the used silverware. A friend and I never used our knife. Only our fork and spoon. Those were taken. When fresh plates were brought, the server brought a fresh fork and spoon for me and the other friend. Attention to detail.\n\nDefinitely going to be a place to visit each time I come to Montreal."
0,"While I enjoyed this end of Fremont versus the touristy area, Insert Coins was a \""bleh\"" experience for me. Personally, I think the arcade game idea was cool...but it wasn't integrated into the rest of the bar atmosphere or decor at all. The games were just...there. Line up against the wall and a standard square bar for drinks in the middle. Seemed as though someone bought a bar that shut down and threw some arcade games in to capitalize on the novelty and nostalgia.\n\nDidn't totally work for me, plus I thought the drinks were pretty pricey compared to others in that walking area.\n\nWhat did me in was when I asked for a water...$3. I asked for tap water and they said \""no, we can only sell you bottled water.\"" Not only is that environmentally unfriendly, but it is a load of crap and a scheme on customers to take more of their money. Yes, you are in business to make a profit...but find another way than customers trying to stay hydrated while having a good time OR by providing a drink for their DD."
0,"for the price of the regular room here at Flamingo, I think I could get better staying elsewhere. the room was old and honestly for the price of the GO room which looks really nice from the pics, I think I would stay at a better hotel. the Flamingo casino is not at all impressive and the room doesn't even make up for it. the one thing I was a little annoyed about was the fact they didn't have a room service menu in the room. I don't know if the maid forgot to put it in there but I had to call the front desk for it. I just got back to my room after a long day and it was late to go out to find something to eat, I would appreciate the fact that there was a menu available to me in my room. the menu made it up to my room 40mins later, which I woke up to from a knock on my door. how annoying? I ended up just going to sleep. I won't come back, regardless how affordable and conveniently located this place might be. for Vegas, it is not worth it in my opinion."

0,"They are right next door to a super busy starbucks, and so I went in one day to see what it was like.  I was very underwhelmed with the service.  The counter makes it kind of hard to see what they are doing behind while making the food.  I was actually late to work becuase they took so long with making my bagel and ringing me out.  The staff is friendly enough but somewhat slow so don't go if ur in a rush!"
1,"Great breakfast place.  Wide variety of omelets and entrees.  Good service, fast seating."
0,"ONLY reason why I'm here, two words OYSTER BAR. \n\nI know my friend LOVES this spot - oyster bar. cheap tables. comp'ed rooms galore. But the thing is, the casino is dingy, old, and ciggie filled I think even if they re-did the entire place it would still reek of old ciggie smells. \n\nThe rooms are tidy, neat, and clean. Yes the tables are hellva cheap and you can take turns gambling, as you're waiting in the never ending line. But it's really what you get what you pay for.\n\nThis place is off strip, on the other side of the 15 off Sahara. Close to the Asian food areas though! No need to pay for valet - their parking is right in the front of the casino/check in area."
0,"I really wanted to like this place because it is close to my home & I think the name is so cute! I went twice within 2 weeks and that is enough for me to know I don't want to go back. I have to eat gluten AND dairy free (Boo Hoo) and I think \""Streets of New York\"", \""Whole Foods\"" and \""California Pizza Kitchen\"" all make a pretty delicious, somewhat reasonably priced pizza. Not so with the Mellow Mushroom. The crust is super thin and doesn't taste very good. They charge a lot of money ($20.00) for a pizza that is 2\"" smaller than their medium, but still hit you up for the medium price. Service is mediocre and I really prefer to spend my money with resaurants that don't treat me as a second class client."

0,"Worst experience ever in Vegas! This used to be our favorite adult pool in Vegas. Today security/staff accused my friend of using drugs while in the bathroom. He was really just using the bathroom, he said they made him extremely uncomfortable. I was supposed to go to this pool again today too but security denied me because I had my prescription medication with me. ( they said Id need to go leave it back in my room)I decided going back and forth from the pool to take my med was too inconvenient so skipped it entirely. It was extremely disappointing, but after I heard about what went down with my friend I was relieved I didn't go. This policy is completely absurd and inconsistent considering I'd been here all weekend without issue. Even went to Encore day club where they nearly gave you a strip search and they didn't even question why I had blood pressure pills."
0,"I lived in Vegas for 6 years and stayed everywhere from the Wynn to the Four Seasons including the old crappy Travelodge on the strip and various places downtown. I've been eager to stay at Rumor as I have only heard good things about it and have been there a few times when it opened originally. So it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT to actually stay there and discover that the rooms and grounds outside of the lobby and bar area are very dirty!!! I stayed last week traveling through home to CA from Colorado. The first room I received had URINE on the bathroom floor and blood smear on the couch! So disgusted I called and informed guest services that I would need a new clean room and explained my current room conditions. They stated that they had several events the past few weeks and a maid that was in a hurry to get off her shift. They gave me a new room, downgraded by the way, old one had a big fancy tub that was probably gnarly anyway. Went to my new room and a little cleaner until I went to bed that night and saw the sheets were torn and filled with mysterious lint so I decided to sleep in top of the covers w a blanket I had brought. The next morning I tip-toed into the shower not knowing what maybe in there and closed the shower curtain only to come to the realization that this was one of the dirtiest hotels I have ever stayed at. Rinsed up, dried off, packed up, and checked out ASAP!! Only spent the night and will never be going back! So sad and disappointed because this hotel used to really be a sweet ruby jewel in the perfect location. No longer a sweet rumor just a nasty old tumor :("
0,"Everything about this place was mediocre - except the service which was excellent.  The food was definitely not anything memorable.  Not bad but not great.  I haven't been to the original Barrio in ages but, my memory says it is much better."
1,"My sister, father, his mother-in-law and myself had just left a showing of Wicked at the Smith Center and were looking for a place to have a late lunch/early dinner.  I suggested Brentwood since it's never packed and the food is always good.\n\nWe got there and I was delightfully surprised to discover that they're currenlty retooling the restaurant and bar to accomodate fans of the Texas Longhorns.  Unfortunately, during this retooling session, the bar was a little sloppy.\n\nThe menu was very small, they were limited on drinks and they were streaming the Longhorns game on a slow connection, so it kept freezing up to buffer.\n\nI'll be honest, the only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because despite the remodeoling faults, my food was delicious and I can't wait to see what this place is like when they're settled and everything runs smoothly."
1,Macarons. Chocolate croissants. Nutella pastries. Delicious. Wouldn't recommend the actual savory foods. Stick with the desserts.

They ordered it & gave me the best price around without the BS of talking me up to something I didn't want. In subsequent visits for adjustment & accessories, they have charged me a fair price for services & have been helpful with any questions I've had about riding & the bike itself. \n\nThere seems to be a lot of store choices in the area so I recommend checking Biketek out first."
0,We decided to have dessert here on a whim. We had not been here in years. Upon arrival Saturday night at 8pm for dessert there was no one In the restaurant. This seemed very odd. we chose Coconut cream pie and carrot cake. The carrot cake was very congealed.  Not really cake at all.  The coconut cream pie was really falling apart and was more liquid rather than solid. We have always loved this place for dessert. Won't be returning anytime soon. Just wondering if this place is on the decline.
0,"This was our second stop for the bachelorette party.  \n\nTao has a really nice atmosphere, but it was so packed that we couldn't enjoy it.  There was absolutely no room on the dancefloor, and even the roof was packed.  After about an hour, I'd had enough.  Even trying to leave was difficult, because of how long the taxi lines were.  \n\nWe got in quickly with some VIP passes, but it just wasn't an enjoyable experience."
1,"My girlfriend and I came to Phoenix from Colorado and decided to go bra shopping. We did a a search and found this Soma store. We almost didn't go because of the bad review. I'm so glad we went! First off the store is located in a really nice part of Phoenix and a really nice shopping area. Second the store is clean and the staff are wonderful. They did a fitting for me they would bring me all kinds of different bras in different sizes shapes and colors until I found exactly the kind of bras that fit perfect I love the bras, underwear and staff. The cherry on the cake was Both my girlfriend and I were able to find new swimsuits at Soma. The ladies there helped us pick them out, make sure they fit right, and they do look  oh so cute, and you know how hard it is to find a good-looking swimsuit. This is a great store to shop in. Have fun!"
0,"Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night for happy hour, which is 4 to 7. Was told by the host that happy hour ends at 6pm when dinner starts.. odd. Anyways, the place looks great as it over looks the pool (which was empty as it was winter and pretty damn cold)  and has a fairly large fireplace located at the end of the room. The restaurant was completely empty, save the lounge which had a few other patrons, about 7 other people. \n\nThe walk to get to this restaraunt was rather odd because we had go up an elevator, then walk across this \""skyline\"" that consisted of walkway with flat escalators. Then, we had to take yet another elevator up to Simon Restaurant and Lounge.\n\nBack to the food. We ordered everything from the happy hour menu. Calamari, Meatball Sliders, Truffle Mac & Cheese, Pizza, Caesar Salad. and a few cocktails. As advertised, the cocktails are $6 but there is an $3 upcharge if you mix it with Redbull or other mixers. The food was just \""OK\"". Nothing was special and nothing was memorable. The service was great on the other hand. The server and busser checked up on us from time to time and were friendly."
0,"It was the Spring Holiday and one cold Friday morning my lovely girlfriend and I searched for a nice family restaurant to have breakfast at. The Yelp reviews pointed at Country Boy and of course, like 99% of the time, Yelp is my compass when it comes to places to eat. Well, HUGE compass interference this time... \nThe place looks like a family restaurant. It is cozy and warm. Perfect for some eggs and tea, we said. How wrong we were! We ordered the regular breakfast, which comes with 2 eggs and a misleading enumeration of meats. We thought we would get bacon and ham and some sausage (which we thought is the only part of the breakfast where you get to choose: regular or Polish). The meal came COLD, no bacon, nor ham, just the sausage (which was terrible). If I wanted cold breakfast I could have stayed at home and ate some coldcuts... Everybody is praising their potatoes, but cold potatoes, no matter how well prepared they are at 8am, they taste awful at 11. The service was also poor, the waitress was always in a rush, even though the restaurant was not even close to being full. \nI will keep trying to find a good breakfast place, but I'm never ever coming here again."
1,I was waiting for Pita Cafe to open as I am a fan of Gyros. I stopped in for lunch today and wasn't disappointed. It definitely has the feel of a small cafe. I was greeted by a very friendly hostess as soon as I walked in. Placing an order is very simple as is paying for your order. \nMy food arrived in a very timely manner. The Gyro was filled with very tasty lamb. All of the ingredients were very fresh. The pita itself was soft and flavorful. I will definitely be back.
1,"Really great curry! Going here for lunch means fighting the rush and that can mean a wait but well worth it. The green curry & bamboo is delicious, I'd highly recommend it! The atmosphere is decent for being in a small strip mall but the service is what makes up for it as the staff is very nice!\n\nThe lunch menu is usually the way to go as it's cheaper than the regular menu. And the portions are usually smaller, unless you love jasmine rice, then order away carb freaks!!"
0,Every time I go there I order chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl just to find out they are out of bread bowls. How do you always run out of bread bowls??? The workers are not very polite either :-( I won't go back instead I'll go to Safeway for my bread bowl and soup.
0,"Plenty of sauce and plenty of rice.  You're better off going to a real buffet that doesn't add tons of sauce to everything you order so that it makes you gag.  Gagging will prevent you from eating more food.  In this case, the \""quality\"" is not even up to par with Todai or any other buffet that serves mediocre sushi.  For $5 you can get a jar of mayonnaise or thousand island dressing to eat with your rice so that you can meet your 3000 calorie intake of carbs.\n\nAvoid this place if you are a true sushi connoisseur, or simply like to eat good quality food."
1,"This place is amazing!  Brenda is very knowledgeable and she recommended a skin care regimen that has really been working for me. She gives great assessments on your current skin conditions and provides tips to maintain.  \n\nWhat I love most about AZ Premier Dermatology is their commitment to natural beauty. They simply believe that healthy skin is beautiful skin. They believe in the confidence that having healthy skin can bring to someone. The never \""push\"" products you don't need. In fact, they frequently help me find something that works for me that I can also afford! They use products with natural ingredients that fall in line with my personal product philosophy. I have complete faith in Arizona Premier Dermatology for all my skin needs!"
0,"If you want Filipino food you're better off going across the street to Papa's.\nDon't bother with the ramen burger, it's over priced and it seems like they stopped putting much care behind it. The pictures I've seen look amazing, in reality they decided to cut out a lot of the toppings, buns were burnt, meat was undercooked. They asked how would I like my burger. I thought the correct answer would be all dressed but he meant how cooked do I want the burger....  Obviously it should be cooked and edible. The burger also comes with \""fries\"" which is basically a shredded potato, equally disgusting.\n\nI had high hopes for this place, been wanting to try the ramen burger for a year, maybe I caught the, on a bad day even though it was quiet, or they treat the take out orders with much less care than  those who dine in.\n\nOverrated, over-priced, definitely not worth the sick I was feeling the next morning."
0,"I went to the bar with friends in the evening. Great wine, great place, but the bar seats are uncomfortable and the iPad menus barely work. Get a glass of wine at Strip Steak instead."
0,"I tried this place again because I was in the area and I needed a place to hang out and grab a bite to eat.  I ordered the curry coconut waffle and fresh fruit.  The waffle was very doughy just as my pancakes were from October 2013.  I informed the waiter and he took my plate and made me another.  However, the second was still doughy, but not as bad as the first.  I didn't send the second one back, but I should have.  I won't go back for breakfast the next time I'm in the area.  I haven't tried the lunch and am willing to give that a try since my son's sandwich looked great and he enjoyed it.  Stay away from the pancakes and waffles!"
0,"OVERPRICED RIP OFF!\n\nWent last night with friends. You have to pay $9 to get in. The food is good but rediculously overpriced. I had a smoothie it was $7 a plate of pasta was $14 and a cup of soda was $6. Very good italian food but the prices were unacceptable. You can't pay with credit cards, so you have to use their ATM machines that charge $5 per transaction.\n\nThe rides... you have to pay $5 per ride or $30 unlimited. What a rip off. With the wife and kids I spent over $300 in 4 hours.\n\nThe parking was a complete fiasco. The the line to get in... 1.5 hour wait in line. They were totally understaffed and the whole thing was not set up with any type of direction. There were so many people walking around you couldn't move. And like most carnivals in Las Vegas, 90% of the people were human scum. Multiple fights breaking out, gang members, etc. As I was waiting for the kids to get off a ride these black guys would walk up to me and ask if I wanted to buy cocaine at least one time every 5 minutes. After 11pm there were literally mobs of black kids straight outta the ghetto wearing gang colors and bling bling everywhere.\n\nThere were only 2 toilets, rent-a-johns, that were so filthy people were running out of them. No toilet paper, feces all over the floor, used tampons on the floor, and a stench that would make anyone puke.\n\nIf this event was run PROPERLY and prices weren't so high they'd get much better reviews. Management needs to get a grip.\n\nAnother tidbit...they need to keep the vendors Italian themed. There were vendors selling time share scams, air conditioning units, vacatins to Mexico, nudie bar tickets, etc. There were also multiple vendors selling the same product (who the hell needs 8 vendors selling plastic jewelry).\n\nOne positive thing, the VERY FEW actual italian people working the booths were very polite. They were elderly but they brought back memories of Little Italy in NYC."
0,Not such a great experience. The wait staff appears uncaring and acts as if you are inconveniencing him to even come into the restaurant. Food is good but will not return due to the waiter disrespect.
1,"Upon my return to Olives, I had one of the most romantic and wonderful experiences ever in Las Vegas. The food was exceptional, the service was out standing. But what took my breath away is sitting outside next to the fountains at night during a full summer moon. I felt like we weren't in Las Vegas, between the cuisine, wine and service. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back upon my next visit to Las Vegas!"
0,"This is my first yelp review.  I did a lot of research and came up with the idea to go to Kai for my boyfriend's and my two year anniversary, based on all the excellent reviews.  We love good food.  We ended up at Kai recently, and I have to say, we were extremely let down.  I was disappointed enough to write my first restaurant review!\n\nWe found the atmosphere to be what you would expect at any mediocre hotel buffet.  The food was definitely good, but we were not blown away.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Journey with wine pairings, while I attempted to order the Short Story with wine pairings (I can't eat that many courses!).  The waiter told us we couldn't do that, and he seemed annoyed with the request.  After much discussion, he ended up just bringing me some of the courses off the Journey menu.  The interaction with him always seemed awkward, and the experience was very uncomfortable.\n\nAfter dropping $600 on this meal (with wine, tip and tax), we were in awe.  Yes, the food here is good.  The wine pairings were well done.  However, for that kind of money, I've had MUCH better experiences (food, service, and ambiance) at Binkley's, Quiessence, Atlas, and Noca.  Wait, I've had better experiences at these restaurants for 1/3 to 1/2 the price.\n\nI honestly don't understand all the amazing reviews of this place.  No one seemed to know our names.  The one time our awkward waiter called me using a last name, it was my boyfriend's (we aren't married).  No one else knew our names.  We did not receive any kind of chocolates or thank-you card even though we stayed at the resort.  \n\nI really wish I had loved Kai as much as all these other reviewers.  I had really been looking forward to it."
1,"After living in Seattle and going to a number of amazing diners, I was thrilled to find Tom's. It tends to be a little greasy, but I love the food. I've been there at least 6-7 times, never a bad experience.\nDISLIKED that the bathroom is hard to find without asking.\nPERFECT hangover food. \n\nI will be back!"
0,"I can not recommend this company for work. They screwed up our appointment x2. The service repair guy's angle immediately upon arrival was trying to push us into buying a new garage door motor right off the bat from him. The price quoted for a repair or replacement of our garage door motor was extraordinarily high. The wrote on their invoice that we \""passed\"" a 12 point safety inspection of our garage door system that was never performed."
0,"I used to go to India Garden regularly for their lunch buffet, which featured a large selection of decent to good quality food for about $10. Early this summer they were shut down by the health department for a while, but this did not deter me from returning once they reopened. To my dismay, however, I found that the quantity and quality of the buffet items had fallen dramatically; several of my favorites were gone and the ones that remained did not taste as good as they used to. What's more, all the food was cold, which was one of the things they were cited for by the health department! I went back a second time, hoping that my previous visit was just an off day, but encountered the same problems. So much for this place; it was nice while it lasted."
1,"I just ate the Chicken Parmesan from this little place and LOVED IT!!!! I didn't expect to get so much food either it could have easily fed 2. The staff was pretty nice also, as I waited for my order one of the guy's served up a free sample of Italian ice which was also very good. I'll definitely be back for more."
0,"Came here expecting a good breakfast but walked out unsatisfied. \n\nI ordered the breakfast waffle sandwich with ham, eggs, cheese, with their special spread on a oat waffle. I didn't care much for the special spread was some sort of sweet jam but it didn't go too well with the sandwich. The egg tasted like they were egg beaters and didn't have much taste. We also ordered the Yooni's favorite. There was nothing special or creative about the waffle - ice cream, chocolate sauce, strawberries, bananas with whipped cream. With all those toppings it just made the waffle soggy. \n\nProbably won't be back here for breakfast."
0,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The rooms are nasty, no fridge and there is an extra charge to use the gym daily. Well as they always say,\""You get what you pay for.\"" This hotel is not worth the money unless you don't care about where you lay your head."
